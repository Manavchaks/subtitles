1
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,210
Yeah?

2
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,667
No, sit properly like 
you're gonna mean it,

3
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,253
like you mean it.

4
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:35,746
No, Waj, don't muck about.

5
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:37,369
Cos the battery's gonna go. Sit ...

6
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,164
Who's mucking about, Barry?
I'm not mucking about.

7
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:40,501
Well, you can't sit like that.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,833
What's wrong with how 
he's sitting, Barry?

9
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:43,496
Come and have a look. It's wrong.

10
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:44,912
There's nothing wrong with it.

11
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:46,912
- Not you!
- Show me.

12
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:49,704
No! Right, what are 
you looking at?

13
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:51,162
There's nothing there.

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,454
No, there's nothing there.
Go and sit down.

15
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:56,495
- You can't see yourself, you mug!
- I thought you were recording it.

16
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:58,162
Right, sit, sit.

17
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:00,245
- Faisal, go away.
- I'm ready, I'm ready.

18
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:02,954
- All right.
- Waj, just relax your face.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,954
Focus on what you're going 
to say. Get on with it.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,120
- Go, before the battery goes.
- One, two ...

21
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:09,704
Three ... action!

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,245
Ey up, you unbelieving 
kuffar bastards.

23
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,870
- I'm gonna turn you baked beans ...
- No, no, no.

24
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:17,829
- What?
- What's with the gun?

25
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,662
- Proper replica, man.
- What for? Action Man?

26
00:01:25,788 --> 00:01:27,537
Replica AK-47.

27
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:30,037
- It's too small, man.
- Not too small, brother.

28
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,496
- My hands.
- Waj ...

29
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,079
Big hands.

30
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:35,746
He can't do it with that gun.

31
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:37,996
Shut up, Barry. Try it without, 
our kid, and let's go.

32
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:39,246
It's too small, believe me.

33
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:41,204
I'll hold it near the camera.
That'll bigger it.

34
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,579
- That'll what?
- That'll bigger it.

35
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:47,621
- Yeah.
- Go now.

36
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:49,704
Ey up, you unbelieving 
kuffar bastards.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,038
No, no, no!
This is absolutely stupid.

38
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:56,663
These are the outtakes.
You know, the bloopers.

39
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,454
- He looks good.
- Today is a wake-up call.

40
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:03,413
Today is an opportunity for 
you to look in the mirror ...

41
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:07,037
at western imperialist culture.

42
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:09,329
Superficial materialism ...

43
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:12,996
ends at the capitalist 
church of McDonald's.

44
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:15,704
Flipping idiots.

45
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,246
It's as though you just had a Big Mac,
completely oblivious to the amount ...

46
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,287
Complete flipping idiots.

47
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:25,829
You could've gone Chicken 
Cottage, proper halal,

48
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:27,996
bargain bucket £6.99.

49
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:30,996
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Chicken Cottage.

50
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:34,829
- There's one where he doesn't 
say that. │- Your bit's good, Dad.

51
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,870
Take the box off.

52
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:40,162
I can't show my face
'cos it's an image.

53
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,495
And images aren't allowed.

54
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:42,829
You know what? 
They're all bloopers.

55
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,662
Take the box off.

56
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,579
What am I going to do if 
he does that at the camp?

57
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:49,579
Is Uncle Faisal ready 
to go to Pakistan?

58
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:53,329
You can't do your jihadi video
with a box on your head.

59
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:54,454
No way.

60
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,453
Ran 23K on the weekend.

61
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,328
6K Saturday morning.

62
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:35,162
Had a light lunch:
Snack-a-Jacks and a medium apple.

63
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:38,953
5K in the afternoon, 'cos obviously 
it was after lunch, so ...

64
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:41,828
Same again Sunday.

65
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:47,161
Although in the afternoon
I only did 4K 'cos I'd had a roast.

66
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:52,120
Would've gone further, you know,
but I started to run a bit lopsided.

67
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:55,578
I'm not slagging my right leg off,
but my left leg is definitely stronger.

68
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:00,036
I think lefty just wants 
it more, you know.

69
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:02,161
Right leg's bone idle.

70
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,870
He'll just wait there,
let lefty pick up the slack.

71
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,286
Before you know it,
you're running in curves.

72
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:12,161
I'm going to have
to put my foot down, you know.

73
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:16,286
Really show him who's boss. Yeah.
Know what I mean?

74
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:18,786
You do know you can talk 
to your legs, don't you?

75
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:20,953
- I need tomorrow off.
- What?

76
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,911
I need tomorrow off,
and the two weeks after that.

77
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:27,119
Jesus, I thought you were serious
about this job, Omar.

78
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,328
I've got to go to a 
wedding in Pakistan.

79
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:32,494
You've got to ask yourself
where you'll be in five years' time.

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,411
- It's an emergency.
- What, an emergency wedding?

81
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,661
Like a shotgun wedding?

82
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:40,994
Like a shotgun wedding, yeah.

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,369
Right.

84
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,869
Well, I'll have a look at the rota.

85
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:54,702
The Feds can track your phone
even if the battery's out.

86
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,787
- Really? │- Really. They can 
see you underground, right?

87
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,912
Can they see you if 
you're not there?

88
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,787
Where's there?

89
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:04,370
I don't know.

90
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:05,995
They can see you everywhere, Waj.

91
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,745
Are they looking at us
through cameras?

92
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,412
- Space cameras, yes.
- But ...

93
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:14,453
My dad says I'm not supposed
to be on camera. It's haram.

94
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,870
With the greatest of respect, 
Faisal, your dad eats newspaper.

95
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:20,703
- Not any more. He eats moths.
- Exactly, bro.

96
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:24,286
Look, the way to stop the Feds
tracking you is very simple.

97
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:29,370
You eat your SIM card.
Get your SIM cards out.

98
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,953
You remove the SIM card and ...
Yes?

99
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,661
- Can I cook mine?
- No. You must eat it raw, like this.

100
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:47,620
Good boys.

101
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:48,953
Salaam, lads.

102
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,786
Walaykum asalaam.

103
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:53,245
- Right.
- We're eating our SIM cards.

104
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,119
Anti-surveillance.

105
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:56,953
You know they still work
inside you, Barry.

106
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,994
- Eh? │- They can still 
track them inside you.

107
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,994
That's not going to be
very helpful in Pakistan.

108
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:04,536
- What?
- In Pakistan.

109
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:06,161
Answered the call, bro.

110
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:07,619
- What call?
- Training camp.

111
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,869
We're upgrading.

112
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,244
We're going.

113
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,744
Why did you get the call?
Why didn't I get the call?

114
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,078
You don't have an uncle in 
Pakistan last time I checked.

115
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,703
You got an uncle in Folkstone. Are 
there any training camps in Folkstone?

116
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,411
Why do we need a training camp, 
anyway? We're primed.

117
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:25,286
We don't need some tramp up a 
mountain, telling us to set a fuse.

118
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:28,536
We don't need some Paki Steptoe
telling us when to go.

119
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,119
You're right, Barry.
We can go whenever we want.

120
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,786
Exactly. Whenever we want, bro.

121
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:35,452
Yeah, if you want to be some kind of
sad loner trenchcoat mafia twazzock.

122
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,619
What do you mean?

123
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:40,494
What I mean is, you can either 
be a stupid nutter Muslim ...

124
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,619
who blows a bag full of nails into 
his own guts at a toilet at TGI's,

125
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:48,244
or you can be a proper soldier
in the Mujahideen.

126
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,119
- I'm already in the Mujahideen.
- No, you're not, bro.

127
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,202
No, not until you join the army ...

128
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,827
and hold the sword ...

129
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:57,619
and touch the sky ―
proper chain of command,

130
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,910
right to the very top.

131
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,577
- All right, I'm coming.
- Oh, you want Paki Steptoe now?

132
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,827
Listen, I am the most 
Al Qaeda one here.

133
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,785
Think of the group.
Think of what we're trying to do.

134
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:11,202
It's best you stay here, bro.

135
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,369
You're a liability and 
you're a loose cannon.

136
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,202
Bollocks, I'm a liability.

137
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:16,702
I am the invisible Jihadi.

138
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:18,202
They seek him here,
they seek him there.

139
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,994
But he's not there,
he's blowing up your slag sister.

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,660
- Invisible?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:25,785
Like the time you got on the local news
for baking a Twin Towers cake ...

142
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,910
and leaving it at the 
synagogue on 9/11?

143
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,285
That is part of the plan.

144
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:31,743
Hide in plain sight, you mug.

145
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,785
And I am coming!

146
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:46,910
You realise, if I don't come
with you to Pakistan, bro,

147
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:48,285
Islam is finished.

148
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:51,035
Listen, bro, we need you over 
here to keep a lid on things.

149
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,827
So what if I'm not here?

150
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:56,368
Cos I've bought a ticket at the 
airport to come with you anyways.

151
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:57,702
You want to come, Fess?

152
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:01,493
Yeah, it's just ... my dad's
seeing creatures that's not there.

153
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,576
- So he'll keep it ticking over 
here, bro. │- Barry, listen.

154
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:05,701
- If you answer this question, 
you can come. │- All right.

155
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:12,910
Don't fuck with me, man!

156
00:08:13,036 --> 00:08:15,951
Don't fuck with Azzam al Britani!

157
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:21,035
Barry, what are you doing?

158
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:22,951
Barry, this is crazy.

159
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:27,370
- Barry, what are you doing?
- Right, if I'm not going, no one is.

160
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,662
Spit it out.

161
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:35,953
It's gone down his neck.

162
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:36,995
Right, frog him.

163
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:39,495
- Frog him in the back.
- Omar, we agreed, no frogging.

164
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:42,495
That was before you swallowed the key.
Every time I've had to frog you.

165
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,703
- Listen, we ...
- Come on. Come on.

166
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:46,786
We said no frogging!

167
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,786
What if you get caught?
I'm not going down.

168
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:53,120
Just 'cos you can't take
a drill in the kneecap.

169
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,161
They'll crack you 
like babies' fingers.

170
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,828
They'll pump you full of Viagra,
make you fuck a dog.

171
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,828
Good prattle, Barry.

172
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,453
You'll end up on YouTube,
blowing Lassie in a ditch.

173
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:20,619
Are they gonna make me fuck
a dog out there, brother Omar?

174
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:21,828
My uncle's connected out there.

175
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:23,536
Only time we're going to see 
cops is for weapons upgrade.

176
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:26,369
All right, Omar,
I'm letting you go to Pakistan.

177
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:28,661
My unit stays here.

178
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,203
- But my unit's the main unit.
- Barry, shut up, mate.

179
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:34,369
Because I tell you, your little brain 
cell might go off now and again,

180
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:35,953
but if your hands even go to move ...

181
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,953
and you try setting up the 
Islamic state of Tinsley again,

182
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,953
going to university lectures,
opening your big mouth,

183
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,328
buying some more silver 
nitrate from Amazon,

184
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:43,494
I'm gonna rip your plugs out.

185
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,953
Not if you're not here, you won't.

186
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,369
Aargh!

187
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:23,285
No, Uncle.

188
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,202
It's my prayer bear.
He does my prayers.

189
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,452
In the name of Allah ...

190
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,285
Which way are we going?

191
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:46,577
All right. OK.

192
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,535
What the fuck's he done
to his rabbits, bro?

193
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:54,702
They're not rabbits, bro.
They're chickens.

194
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,952
They're fucking rabbits.

195
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,702
Bro, if they're rabbits,
where are their ears?

196
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,452
That's what I'm saying.

197
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:16,785
What?

198
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:20,993
What's he saying?

199
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,952
I'm asking, would he kill you?

200
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:26,576
Pack up.

201
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,993
If you make me trouble ...

202
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:38,910
Alaykum salaam.

203
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,326
- Would you kill me, then?
- No, course not.

204
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,160
Come on.

205
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,576
I'd kill you, bro.

206
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,701
Would you?

207
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:55,494
- Yeah.
- Right, good.

208
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,661
Cos I would kill you, bro.

209
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,619
Bro, seriously, I'd kill you.

210
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:03,202
Course I would.

211
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:05,202
Aye, I would. 
I'd kill you like that.

212
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:07,119
- Flipping heck, man. Would you?
- Yeah, course.

213
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,785
I sort of thought I were 
joking a bit there, bro.

214
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,160
We're soldiers, bro.
Whatever's asked, you do it.

215
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:16,119
You do the right thing.

216
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:17,285
Right?

217
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:19,452
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

218
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:22,744
It's life, isn't it? It's just 
life. What is that? It's nothing.

219
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,369
It's like being stuck in 
the queue at Alton Towers.

220
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,994
Do you want to be in the queues
or do you want to be on the rides?

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,619
You want to be on the rides, don't you?
You want to be on Nemesis, Oblivion.

222
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,327
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

223
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,285
- Yeah. You with me?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,202
- Rubber Dinghy Rapids.
- Yeah, Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

225
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:40,702
Right?

226
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,868
- OK, I would kill you, 
brother Omar. │- Would you?

227
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,743
- Yeah, I would.
- What would you do?

228
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:49,368
- I'd smash your head off with a thing.
- Yeah. Know what I'd do?

229
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:52,952
I'd grab one of these hooks, Waj. I'd dig 
it in your belly, rip your guts out.

230
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:55,285
Spill it all out on the floor,
like Mortal Combat.

231
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:57,535
I'd fucking ... 
I'd take this, right?

232
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,827
- Yeah? │ - And I'd fucking 
run you over with a tractor.

233
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,118
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Soldiers.

234
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:03,743
Soldiers, brother. Mujahid.

235
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:05,035
Mujahid.

236
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,493
Good lad.

237
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,035
Come on. You want some?

238
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:11,951
Yeah, you do want some, rabbit.

239
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:14,160
You fucked-up rabbit with no ears.

240
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:16,576
- I'll fucking ... I'll have you.
- They're chickens, man.

241
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:19,285
- I'd roast you.
- Waj, they're chickens.

242
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:57,368
I'm coming. Coming.

243
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,243
I'm coming.

244
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:16,451
Come on, Waj.

245
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,242
Fuck off, bro. East is that way.

246
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,617
That way is East, bro.

247
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:31,909
That way is East.

248
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:33,909
- We've flown over Mecca now.
- Paki's gone mental, bro.

249
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,492
Mecca is in the East, yeah.

250
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:40,492
Where the sun ... where it rises,
you behn choad paki prong!

251
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:51,034
Turn around. 
I'll explain to you later.

252
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,325
Fuck! Waj, come on. Come on!

253
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:02,700
Go, go, go. Come on.

254
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:04,159
- Come on, Waj.
- OK, OK.

255
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,450
Hey, brother Emir, 
I'll take it out.

256
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:14,284
Too high, too high.

257
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,700
Yeah, that's what I was thinking 
actually. What is that, 2,000 feet?

258
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:21,658
- What?
- Nothing.

259
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,576
I've never stood up in public and
professed any in-depth knowledge of Islam,

260
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:37,118
but what I do know is that most British
Muslims don't want to be out abroad,

261
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:39,326
fighting British foreign policy.

262
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:43,493
What they want to do is get on
peacefully with their daily lives.

263
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,201
- And we support that.
- Yeah, yeah.

264
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,701
A good Muslim
always keeps his mouth shut.

265
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:52,326
Yeah? Yeah? Are you all surprised
kids are going off to training camps?

266
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,409
- That is not what I am saying.
- Why are kids going to training camps?

267
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:58,242
First off, I object
to the term "training camps".

268
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:00,784
- You just used it.
- No, I did not.

269
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,826
It's a western fantasy.

270
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:05,617
You people think of Muslims
running around the mountains ...

271
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:06,826
with guns and bombs.

272
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,117
That'd suit you down to 
the ground, wouldn't it?

273
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:12,742
- But they do exist, don't they?
- I'm not saying they don't exist.

274
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:14,326
What I'm saying, if you'll listen,

275
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:17,659
is that if they didn't exist, you 
people would have to invent them.

276
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:20,076
- That's absolute rubbish.
- Yeah, man.

277
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:24,034
- This whole debate is twisted, man.
- We'll take questions later, please.

278
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,117
You think we're all 
bombers, don't you?

279
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:28,075
- That is absolutely ...
- No, no, no.

280
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,909
When you look at someone like 
me, you think "bomber", right?

281
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:33,242
- Yeah, you do.
- That is not the case.

282
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,075
Why shouldn't I be a bomber
if you treat me like one?

283
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:38,742
- Mashallah, brother.
- Yeah, Mashallah.

284
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,367
Yeah.

285
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:43,617
I'm the Mujahideen
and I'm making a scene ...

286
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:45,867
Now you's gonna feel
what the boom-boom means ...

287
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:48,659
It's like Tupac said,
"When I die, I'm not dead" ...

288
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:51,909
We are the martyrs,
you're just smashed tomatoes ...

289
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:54,575
Allahu Akbar!

290
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,033
Mashallah, brother.

291
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,117
Oh, what, man? Come on.

292
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:06,242
What? Just 'cos I'm Muslim,
you thought it was real?

293
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:09,200
Oh, here they come!

294
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:12,450
Here come your stooges, Mr. Storge.

295
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:15,075
Police state! Police state!

296
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,242
Police state! Police state!

297
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:22,033
Remember my name, brothers and 
sisters. I'm going to Cuba!

298
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:26,492
He's being rendered!
He's being rendered!

299
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,783
Hey, bro, bro. Down here.

300
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:37,658
Need a lift?

301
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,741
Yeah, man. Wait. Yeah.

302
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,866
Oh, man!

303
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:45,825
Yo!

304
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,741
You're a lege. You're a lege, bro!

305
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,075
Not so bad yourself, brother.
What's your name?

306
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:53,908
Hassan Malik. "The Mal".

307
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,741
- The Mal?
- Yeah.

308
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,533
Nice little stunt back there.

309
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:00,449
And you know what?

310
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:02,533
You're a total piece of shit, mate.

311
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,366
You're worse than the specially trained 
rapists they use in Guantánamo.

312
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:10,074
- You what? │- Yeah, you're 
not ignorant like them!

313
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,324
You know you should 
be doing something.

314
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,533
- I am doing something.
- What, that?

315
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,366
I'm the Mujahideen and ...
thingy, thingy, rap, rap

316
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:19,533
Eh?

317
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:24,199
It was jihad of the mind,
the gesture that messed yer.

318
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:26,824
Wasthe prophet, Sal Allaahu
Alayhi wa Sallam, about gestures?

319
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,991
Hm? Did he smash the pagan statues ...

320
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,949
or did he just stand there, 
making a gesture?

321
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,991
Is this a gesture?

322
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:44,824
- That was for real, brother.
- Yeah ...

323
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,741
Is you as for real as that?

324
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,616
- Yeah.
- How often do you go to mosque?

325
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:54,367
When I can. Most weeks. 
Friday prayers.

326
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:59,117
Once a year is too often.
The mosques have lost it, brother.

327
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:02,533
They're full of losers and spies.

328
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,575
These are real bad times, bro.

329
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:07,158
Islam is cracking up.

330
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:09,366
We got women talking back.

331
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:12,908
We got people playing 
stringed instruments.

332
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:16,241
It's the end of days.

333
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,283
Do you want to be for real?

334
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,033
Well, yeah, of course.

335
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,158
Are you sure?

336
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,533
100 percent.

337
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,450
Yeah, come here.

338
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,866
Fuck you, Omar!

339
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,074
Big enough for you now, Barry?

340
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,533
Am I blowing a dog in a 
ditch or am I Paki Rambo?

341
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,658
I'm getting my pictures, 
Mujahid-style.

342
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:06,991
- James Fuck Bond?
- No, no.

343
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,241
What the fuck are you doing, Waj?

344
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:32,782
Stay here and clean the guns.

345
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:35,907
No, no, listen. 
We need an Al Qaeda emir.

346
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,366
It was my fault, bro, OK?
Let Omar go.

347
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,115
You fucking Mr. Beans.

348
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:50,240
- But we haven't got an emir yet.
- It's good.

349
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:02,990
- Just getting my pictures, bro.
- Waj, go away right now.

350
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,574
Come on.

351
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,324
- Where is it?
- Down here.

352
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:28,698
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

353
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:52,990
Liquid peroxide.

354
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:54,990
Three years of stockpiling.

355
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:58,198
- Where did you get it all?
- A wholesale shop down the road.

356
00:21:58,324 --> 00:21:59,990
- All from the same shop?
- Yeah.

357
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:02,656
- You mug, you'll get us nicked!
- No.

358
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,656
I use different voices 
every time I go in.

359
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:08,115
Different what? Different voices.
Show me.

360
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:10,323
- What?
- Show me the voices. Come on.

361
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:18,406
- One of them's ... It's my voice.
- Right.

362
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:21,949
Can I have 12 bottles 
of bleach, please?

363
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,282
I know what that sounds like.
Give me another one.

364
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,449
IRA voice.

365
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:30,449
IRA voice?

366
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:31,740
They're terrorists, Faisal.

367
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:34,365
Why do you want to do a terrorist 
voice? You'll get us nicked!

368
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:37,407
- I'll be disguised then, won't I?
- Yeah, but as a terrorist.

369
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:40,824
Let's hear the voice.

370
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:47,907
Can I have ... 12 bottles 
of bleach, please?

371
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:51,865
And then I've got one 
like this as well.

372
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,407
Can I have 12 bottles 
of bleach, please?

373
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,699
What's that?

374
00:22:56,825 --> 00:23:01,782
It's a woman's voice because 
I got loads of liquid peroxide.

375
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:03,865
Probably thought 
that she'd go and ...

376
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,282
And what?

377
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:08,532
dye her hair or something.
- And her beard?

378
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:11,240
- You got a beard.
- I covered it.

379
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,782
You covered your beard. How?

380
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:24,490
Right, so you went into a shop, with 
your hands on your face like that ...

381
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:26,365
and asked for 12 bottles of bleach?

382
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:29,948
So, why has she got her hands
on her face, Fess?

383
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,781
Cos she's got a beard.

384
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:43,531
I'm sorry, brother Omar.

385
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,781
Maybe it were God's will.

386
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:48,448
Maybe it were God's will
I would do my video so ...

387
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:52,365
- So maybe it's not my fault.
- No, it is your fault.

388
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:56,573
It were God's will that you were acting
like a complete prat, apparently.

389
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:58,656
It was defo your fault.

390
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:03,739
So, if that were God's will,
then am I God's fault?

391
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:06,323
Maybe I'm God's mistake.

392
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:09,531
- Does that mean I'm going to 
hell, brother? │- Sh, sh, sh.

393
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,239
- Do mistakes go to hell?
- Shh, Waj.

394
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:12,406
What?

395
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:16,531
- That's a drone.
- Hide!

396
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:19,989
- It's flying low. It's going 
to attack. │- Let's go!

397
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:22,073
Where are we gonna go, Waj?
We've got to take it out.

398
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,239
Take it out with what?
We ain't got no bullets.

399
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,573
- This is my mistake, bro.
- No, no, no. Waj, listen.

400
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,906
Think about it. This is God's plan.
He's put us here to defend the camp.

401
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:33,448
This is our jihad.

402
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,739
- Think about it.
- This is my mistake, brother.

403
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:38,156
That's the devil that's in your 
brain giving it the wasa-wasa.

404
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:40,531
Don't listen to him.
God's in your heart, bro.

405
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,072
Right? What does your heart say?
Trust me. Come on.

406
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:47,072
It says maybe we should ...

407
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:48,781
Huh?

408
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:51,614
Maybe we should flipping pop it, 
brother, get back on jihad.

409
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,697
Good, Waj.

410
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:55,572
Right, OK.

411
00:24:57,615 --> 00:25:00,489
What are we going to use?

412
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:03,322
- Fucking yes, bro.
- Shh, shh. Right, come on.

413
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:06,989
- Proper Mujahid, yeah?
- Yeah.

414
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:08,989
- Rubber Dinghy Rapids, brother?
- Mind out the way now.

415
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,405
- All right, OK.
- Come on.

416
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:13,114
- Flipping pop it, brother.
- OK.

417
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:24,280
Brother Omar!

418
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:28,905
The Arabs!

419
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:31,364
The emir!

420
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:36,197
Flipping shit.

421
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:41,072
Is this God's will, bro?

422
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:44,613
Tell me it is, bro. 
Tell me it's God's will.

423
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,863
Fucking hell, bro.

424
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:50,574
We've got to go, Waj.
We've got to get out of here.

425
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:05,907
I can't hear nothing!

426
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,907
I can't hear nothing!

427
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:19,074
Morning, officer.

428
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,032
You've been rumbled.

429
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:37,323
My plan is, right, to 
put a bomb on a crow

430
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:41,282
and fly it into one of them 
towers full of Jews and slags.

431
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:44,282
I keep crows in here. Have a look.

432
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:46,823
We're way beyond crows now, Faisal.

433
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:48,907
We are really going 
to blow the lid off.

434
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:51,157
Yeah, I'm all about 
blowing the lid off, man.

435
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,406
- Blow my lid off.
- Bomb the mosque!

436
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,906
What?

437
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,823
- The Masjid?
- Yeah, the masjid, the mosque.

438
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:03,323
But we go in dressed like kuffars.

439
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:07,573
They think it's the unbelievers attacking
so all the Muslims rise up and fight back.

440
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:11,615
Stoke things up proper big time,
fast-track the final days ― total war!

441
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:15,990
- That is sick, man.
- What does Omar say?

442
00:27:16,116 --> 00:27:17,823
Who is this Omar?

443
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:20,240
Don't sweat that.
He's one of my boys.

444
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,406
I've sent him off to training camp
to bring him up to scratch.

445
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:25,823
But my dad goes to the masjid.
What if he's in masjid?

446
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:28,031
Has your dad ever bought
a Jaffa orange?

447
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:29,989
Once or twice.

448
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,864
Right, he's buying nukes 
for Israel, bro. He's a Jew.

449
00:27:47,657 --> 00:27:49,031
- Barry!
- Where?

450
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:51,573
- Where is he?
- What are we going to say, again?

451
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:55,573
Waj, we're going to say we're being
sent for special training in Somalia.

452
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:58,489
- Somalia?
- Yeah, OK.

453
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:10,364
- You all right, Barry?
- Yeah. What happened?

454
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:13,322
Nothing happened.
We're being sent to ...

455
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:17,614
Bollocks! You fucked up, 
you fucking losers!

456
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,364
I told you you should 
have taken me.

457
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,989
- We're going to Somibia, Barry.
- Somalia.

458
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:24,572
- Special training.
- "Special training."

459
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:28,739
- Bollocks! Something happened.
- Nothing happened, Barry.

460
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:31,655
Look at the state of you.
No luggage, back early.

461
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:33,072
Yeah, something happened.

462
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:37,364
- Yeah, something did happen.
- Yeah, you fucked up.

463
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,780
No, we got an emir and he 
told us that we're on.

464
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:41,947
What?

465
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:45,655
We've got an emir
and he says that we're on.

466
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,530
- Are you on as well, bro?
- Yeah, for real.

467
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:52,114
- Good.
- Alhamdulillah.

468
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:59,030
What about the Arabs, bro?
What about the Arabs?

469
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:03,613
They weren't Arabs,
they were bad tribesmen.

470
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,363
- What?
- Bad tribesmen.

471
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,447
- So it were good, what we did?
- Yeah.

472
00:29:11,781 --> 00:29:14,113
What the fuck is 
Special Branch doing here?

473
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,905
Oh, no, no, no.
That's Hassan. He's in.

474
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,614
- Since when, Barry?
- He's one of us.

475
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,531
- Is he fuck?
- How was it, boys? Was it amazing?

476
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,364
What, my dad's funeral?
How could that be amazing?

477
00:29:25,824 --> 00:29:27,073
You're joking!

478
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:30,281
He was pecked to death by chickens.
Why would I joke about that?

479
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,448
Ignore him, bro. This is Omar,
this is Waj and this is Hassan Malik.

480
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:35,156
Yeah, man, I'm the Mal.

481
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,781
Frog him.

482
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:40,614
No, don't sweat it, bro.
He's been tested.

483
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,114
- Really?
- Yeah, he tested me, man.

484
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,947
How did he do that, then?

485
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:47,406
- He made me do that bean thing, man.
- What bean thing?

486
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,781
You know, when you put a bean
up the end of your knob, man.

487
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:56,989
We're on the parking. Let's go.

488
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:58,989
- Barry?
- We're on the parking.

489
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:01,656
- What's he saying about a bean, Barry?
- You mean, I didn't have to?

490
00:30:01,782 --> 00:30:03,906
Bro, he's landed you right in it.

491
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,739
I've got no need for a beanfucker
or a TV Paki or a coconut spook.

492
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:08,906
Now, frog him!

493
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:10,905
Omar, he's loaded. His dad's loaded.

494
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:13,822
- What, from MI5 payroll?
- No, he's got a clothes factory.

495
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:16,405
- Great. Merry Christmas. Frog him.
- I can get you a van.

496
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:19,822
- I can nick a van.
- So you'd steal from your own dad?

497
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:23,405
Well, yeah, yeah.

498
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,989
Right, well, you're still walking.

499
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,489
Listen, behn choad, next time I see 
you, you'd better have a fucking van,

500
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:31,572
or I'm gonna floss your 
balls with razor wire.

501
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,072
You played that wrong, mate.

502
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,530
- You're on one, Omar.
- Drive!

503
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:50,072
- Did you fix this, Barry?
- Yeah, I fixed it.

504
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:53,447
- Did you do it yourself or something?
- Yes, I did it myself.

505
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,113
So is he in or what, Omar?

506
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:04,822
What choice have I got, Barry? He's 
either in or I've got to kill him.

507
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:07,697
Good. I knew you'd like him.

508
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,988
Simba and Pumbaa were 
out on their own.

509
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:25,113
And Scar was looking for them and if 
he found them, he'd kill them, but ...

510
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,363
- Dad?
- Yeah?

511
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:28,405
Did you blow up any kuffars?

512
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:30,071
What?

513
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:31,613
At the wedding?

514
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:35,655
Do you want to hear
what happened to Simba or not?

515
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:38,321
- Yeah!
- Right, so ...

516
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:42,113
Simba and Pumbaa
were out on their own,

517
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:44,738
when all of a sudden they saw this ...

518
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:50,654
this big evil bird, this big bird, that 
Scar had sent out to look for them.

519
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,654
This big, evil vulture, 
coming right at them.

520
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,946
"There it is," said Simba.
He spotted it,

521
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:59,571
this big evil vulture,
coming straight for them,

522
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:01,196
coming right at them.

523
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,321
Then what, Dad?

524
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:09,529
Well, Simba had to bring it down,
otherwise it'd kill them.

525
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:12,571
So, what he did was,
he grabbed a stone ...

526
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,654
and he chucked it at the bird,
only he chucked it so hard,

527
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,612
it was such a strong powerful throw,
that his arm went all the way round.

528
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:23,112
Behind. He threw it so hard,
it went a mile behind him.

529
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,987
And it hit Mufasa.

530
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,904
Wise, strong Mufasa, Simba's dad.

531
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,696
It hit him accidentally on 
the head and killed him.

532
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:35,279
But didn't Scar kill Mufasa?

533
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:38,362
Yeah, in the film. This is 
real life, I'm talking about.

534
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:40,237
So Simba had a choice.

535
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:42,487
He could either tell his friends
what had happened and create confusion,

536
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:46,822
or keep it a secret and lead all his 
friends in a big fight against Scar.

537
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:48,822
What do you think he did?

538
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:50,613
He had to tell the truth.

539
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:55,571
But he's got to fight 
Scar, hasn't he?

540
00:32:55,698 --> 00:32:58,530
Telling the truth means giving up.

541
00:32:58,656 --> 00:32:59,946
Would Simba give up?

542
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:02,155
- Simba would never give up.
- Exactly.

543
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:04,530
Exactly. So ...

544
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:08,530
Simba kept it all a secret.

545
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:11,696
And he led Pumbaa and Timon
and all his friends,

546
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:15,738
he led them all in 
a fight against Scar.

547
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,530
And he vanquished Scar,

548
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:19,863
and Simba became the new Lion King.

549
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:22,946
- Yes.
- Yeah.

550
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,030
Bedtime for you,

551
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:28,613
soldier.

552
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:34,654
All right, lads, this is it.

553
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,946
This is it, boys.

554
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:41,821
I've spoken to the emir.
I have, and ...

555
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:43,571
How did you do that?

556
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:50,946
Email drop box and the children's
instant messaging site, Party Puffin.

557
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,488
I've been on that.

558
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,404
- Good, Waj.
- Proper good.

559
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,029
Do we have to be puffins as well?

560
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:59,654
Yeah, I'll give you all usernames
and passwords after this meeting.

561
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,112
I'm not sure I want to be a puffin.

562
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,821
You don't have to be
if you don't want to, Barry.

563
00:34:02,947 --> 00:34:05,154
- Bagsy a blue one, yeah?
- Good, Waj.

564
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:08,946
Now, I've spoken to him.

565
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,737
My puffin has communicated 
with his puffin.

566
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:17,446
And he's told us 
to make some bombs.

567
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:20,362
So we're going to take Faisal's 
gear to the secret flat.

568
00:34:20,488 --> 00:34:23,737
We can hide it under the 
costumes in Hassan's van.

569
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,696
We'll put the bleach on the boil.

570
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:31,696
We have instructions to bring havoc
to this bullshit, consumerist,

571
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,820
godless, Paki-bashing,

572
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,695
Gordon Ramsay "Taste the Difference"
speciality cheddar,

573
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:38,945
torture-endorsing,
massacre-sponsoring,

574
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:43,112
"Look-at-me-dancing-pissed
with-my-nob-out", Sky1 Uncovered,

575
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,945
"Who-gives-a-fuck
about-dead-Afghanis?" Disneyland.

576
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:47,987
- Mashallah!
- Mashallah, brother Omar.

577
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:50,070
- Mashallah.
- Fuck mini Babybels.

578
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,362
Puffin says, "Find a target."

579
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:56,237
Well, we got a target, bro.
We're all agreed.

580
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:58,195
What is it?

581
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:00,029
- It's the mosque.
- What?

582
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:01,654
Bomb the mosque,

583
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,695
radicalise the moderates,
bring it all on.

584
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,528
OK, right. No, I like that.
I do like that, that's brilliant.

585
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:11,528
Let's take out a bunch of Muslims
because they're the real enemy.

586
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:14,528
Once we've done that, why don't 
we truck-bomb a kebab shop ...

587
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,487
and fly a jumbo jet
into Waj's mum's head?

588
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:21,487
Why don't we get a pig and 
staple-gun it to our foreheads?

589
00:35:21,613 --> 00:35:24,778
But if we bomb the mosque, it 
will make all the Muslims rise up.

590
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:28,278
My cousin, Faz, died,

591
00:35:28,404 --> 00:35:31,362
defending a mosque in Bosnia.

592
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,237
Did he flipping rise up, bro?

593
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:36,028
Let's bomb Boots.

594
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:40,570
They sell condoms that make 
you want to bang white girls.

595
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:43,028
- I second that. Boots.
- Right.

596
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:46,445
- They nabbed me nicking Lynx display.
- Think bigger than a chemist's.

597
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:49,903
I'm not blowing my guts out over
a bunch of tampons and cotton buds.

598
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:52,861
What we're going to do
has got to last in history,

599
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,445
echo through the ages.

600
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,445
- Like bomb a mosque.
- Barry, we're not bombing a mosque.

601
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:59,528
You don't get it, do you, Omar?

602
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:01,403
We radicalise the moderates!

603
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,861
The ummah rises up, 
it all kicks off!

604
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:07,445
I do get it. I'll tell you what it's like.
It's like you're in a fight with someone,

605
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:09,819
and they're punching you
in the face, right?

606
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:13,570
And so what you go and do is,
you punch yourself in the face.

607
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:14,779
So what if he's not?

608
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,279
I'm having a fight
with this fictionary man,

609
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:21,654
and he's not punching me hard enough
to make me go mental and win.

610
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,529
Let's do an experiment, Barry.
We'll have a fight right now.

611
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:26,737
When you start losing and 
you're not doing very well,

612
00:36:26,863 --> 00:36:29,279
you punch yourself in the face,
go mental and start winning.

613
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:31,779
- Show them all how it works.
- I'm not gonna punch myself.

614
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,279
Why not? You're the Muslims.
You're getting attacked.

615
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:37,654
Go fucking mental, Barry.
Show 'em how it works.

616
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,112
- Come on.
- I'm not a mosque!

617
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:41,612
This is not how it works!

618
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:45,695
Punch yourself, Baz.

619
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:48,403
Bomb the mosque, Barry!
Bomb it!

620
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,653
Bomb the mosque!

621
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:52,820
Bomb the mosque, Barry!

622
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,403
He's bombed the mosque!
He's just bombed the mosque!

623
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:58,778
Barry, where are the moderates?
The moderates should be coming now.

624
00:36:58,904 --> 00:37:01,362
Right, if I was a mosque,
which I am not,

625
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:04,403
then there would be all 
moderates behind my nose,

626
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:06,487
bursting to come out and rise up.

627
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:09,070
Would there?
Ooh, they are, bro, eh?

628
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:12,153
Barry, the Sufi Muslim Council's
coming out your nose.

629
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:15,320
Oh, you've just wiped them out.
You've just wiped them out.

630
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:18,945
Do you think we should still
bomb the mosque, Barry?

631
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,778
- Come back.
- Barry, I got you a J-cloth for the ...

632
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:25,028
- Oooh!
- Barry!

633
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:27,070
For fuck's sake, Barry!

634
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:06,153
Oi! Oi!

635
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:09,528
Turn that off.
There's common areas out there.

636
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,319
We got to play it, Barry.
This is our cover, man. We're a band.

637
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:15,986
- We're a what?
- We're a band.

638
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,861
Bollocks! Turn it off.

639
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,236
Bro, turn it off.

640
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,361
What's with the chicken?

641
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:31,319
It's beard protection 
from the bleach.

642
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:34,152
Yeah, he's the drummer, man.

643
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,402
- Chicken drummer.
- Yeah, Barry.

644
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:41,611
You broke the chicken's beak, 
didn't you? Remember?

645
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,569
Yeah, Barry, you broke his beak.

646
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:46,569
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but 
beaks get broken in war, don't they?

647
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:48,027
- Do they?
- Yeah, they do.

648
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:51,861
We're not about protecting beaks,
we're about blowing them off.

649
00:38:51,987 --> 00:38:53,652
Yeah?

650
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:56,402
Well, go and unload the van.
I'm not doing all the work.

651
00:39:00,486 --> 00:39:02,069
Waj! Waj!

652
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:03,819
Anti-surveillance.

653
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:11,652
Not you, mate, you're still here.
Get in there.

654
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:21,110
- What are you doing?
- Just in case they're taking pictures.

655
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,985
- What?
- Barry says you come out blurry.

656
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:26,735
Right, stop it!

657
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:28,985
Stop it!

658
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:33,943
CCTV's a video.

659
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:37,152
You're just gonna look
like a bunch of Sufis on speed.

660
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:40,360
Next time Barry tells you
to do something, don't.

661
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:49,361
- You all right, Alice? How's it going.
- All right, Wasim? Yeah.

662
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,153
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

663
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,444
- All right, Jason?
- All right.

664
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:56,028
Who's this one?

665
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:57,528
This is ... Claude.

666
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:59,944
Claude, this is Alice.
She's got the flat next door.

667
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,403
- Hello, Claude.
- Hi.

668
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:05,361
- What's this? │- Claude's the 
new member of our band.

669
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,027
- Band?
- He's the new member.

670
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,569
- I used to be in a band.
- Did you?

671
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:15,152
Yeah. Until all the 
birds fell off the roof ...

672
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:18,236
I don't know if you remember.

673
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:23,152
All right, then, Alice,
we'll see you later. Come on, lads.

674
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:25,361
Come through.

675
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:29,152
- Which one are you?
- Er, Claude.

676
00:40:29,278 --> 00:40:31,361
- Claude?
- Yeah.

677
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,111
Are you French?

678
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:35,444
Yeah.

679
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,777
See you.

680
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:52,944
Right, Mister Newsman
in the newsroom, after three.

681
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,152
Three, two, one ...

682
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:59,360
Yes, it was us.

683
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:02,527
We have struck you
where you least expected it.

684
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:05,194
We have bombed the mosque.

685
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,193
Only in the days of the final jihad ...

686
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:11,985
What are you doing here?

687
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:14,485
Well, you told us to come round.

688
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:18,027
We've just come through the back.
Anti-surveillance, like you said.

689
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:20,027
Right, well, I'm doing my tape.

690
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:21,985
But we're not bombing the mosque.

691
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:24,985
- What?
- We're not bombing the mosque.

692
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:28,693
Look, I'm just doing this tape in case
the plans change to bomb the mosque.

693
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,360
If they did change, isn't the whole
point of it to blame it on the kuffar ...

694
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:33,943
and not take responsibility for it?

695
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:37,318
What do you know about it? It was 
my idea in the first place, not yours!

696
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:40,068
Now, fuck off!
I'm doing my tape. Go on.

697
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:41,235
All right, Barry?

698
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:44,860
- What, you're here as well?
- Yeah. Why? What's going on?

699
00:41:44,986 --> 00:41:47,735
He said he was going 
to bomb the mosque.

700
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:49,360
- Did you say that, Barry?
- No.

701
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:51,151
- Yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

702
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:54,151
- What did you say, then? │ - I said 
I was gonna bomb something else.

703
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:57,068
What did you say you 
were gonna bomb?

704
00:41:57,194 --> 00:41:59,193
Hm?

705
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,985
Fuck off!

706
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:02,568
Fuck off out of my house!

707
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:05,818
Oh, Barry, you moron.

708
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:12,776
- Salaam, Ahmed.
- Alaykum salaam.

709
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:17,359
- Omar, it's your brother. Come in.
- No, I'm OK.

710
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:20,401
Just come in and sit down.

711
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:21,943
- Salaam Alaykum.
- Alaykum salaam.

712
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:26,693
Just come in and sit down.

713
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:30,068
I'm not in the same room.
You can come in.

714
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:31,818
You are.

715
00:42:31,944 --> 00:42:33,401
I'm not.

716
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:35,276
The wall has been taken 
out, so you are.

717
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:40,318
Have you come to drop some fatwas,
'cos we've just had the carpet cleaned?

718
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:46,317
Not in this house, bro.

719
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:48,776
- Freeze or I'll blow your guts out.
- All right, go easy.

720
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:51,234
OK. Right, come on!

721
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,984
You've got 30 seconds!

722
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,442
- What are you teaching him, Omar?
- It's a water pistol. Have you lost it?

723
00:42:57,568 --> 00:43:01,276
Have you got 150 quotes from scholars
saying we can't squirt a water pistol?

724
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,817
There is no justification
for what you are planning.

725
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:06,984
- What am I planning, bro?
- You tell me.

726
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,151
- Want to know what I am planning?
- Yeah.

727
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:14,736
Sure you can handle it, bro?
Yeah? You ready?

728
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:17,403
It's not a proper plan yet, yeah?

729
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:19,278
But I'm thinking, inshallah,

730
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:22,153
I'm going to go upstairs
and run a hot bath, right?

731
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:24,611
Then come back down and make 
beans on toast. I'm proper hungry.

732
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:26,319
- Very funny.
- What?

733
00:43:30,528 --> 00:43:33,027
Is it, bro? Have you got 
opinions to back that up?

734
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,277
I have got 18 opinions, 
all very good ones.

735
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:38,944
You know what? It's not Top Trumps.
Muslims are getting pasted and you go,

736
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,694
"I've got 60,000 opinions
saying we can't fight back.

737
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,819
"We must measure our beard with a ruler
and lock our wives in cupboard!"

738
00:43:45,945 --> 00:43:48,861
That's not a joke, is it, bro?

739
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:51,819
It is not a cupboard, 
it is a small room.

740
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:55,194
Oh, come on. It was a flipping 
toilet till you took the china out.

741
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,944
I don't argue with women.

742
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,777
No, you don't.
You lock 'em in a cupboard.

743
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,319
Omar, your wife is out of control.

744
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:03,444
I don't know how to control her.
Help me out.

745
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,777
Am I ... Am I out of control? Ooh.

746
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:09,360
Do it again. He won't fight back.

747
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:11,444
- What am I like? I'm out of control.
- Obey me, wife. Obey me.

748
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,735
Go and do it.

749
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,444
Fight back, brother!

750
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,110
What's all the violence, brother?

751
00:44:17,236 --> 00:44:21,152
- Are you fighting back? In self-defence?
- This is not fighting.

752
00:44:21,278 --> 00:44:24,985
- By the law of Sharia, I am not 
fighting. │- You're a proper Mujahid!

753
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:26,444
By the law ...

754
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,985
- I am not fighting.
- You're so violent, bro!

755
00:44:31,486 --> 00:44:32,777
Hey, Omar.

756
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,568
- You're terrible, you are.
- I'm out of control.

757
00:44:35,694 --> 00:44:37,152
Aren't you, eh?

758
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,193
- That's twice as much, bro.
- This one's gonna leave a mark.

759
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:04,985
Just drop it.

760
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:13,151
Ooh!

761
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,276
Shit, man!

762
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:17,485
- Come on, bro. Give me that.
- Jew.

763
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:18,985
Gay.

764
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:20,860
Fed.

765
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:24,235
Sodomite.

766
00:45:25,027 --> 00:45:26,068
Gynaecologist.

767
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:29,985
Innocent bloke. Doesn't exist.

768
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:34,068
Leonard Cohen.
Here, you give me that.

769
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:36,318
You do some work.

770
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,818
This one's gonna be
like a grenade, man.

771
00:45:42,944 --> 00:45:45,734
- Oh, bro.
- Here, watch this.

772
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,484
Watch this, bro!

773
00:45:56,527 --> 00:45:59,651
Come on, lads. Why don't we just
pick up the phone and call the cops?

774
00:45:59,777 --> 00:46:01,734
Right? Come on.

775
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:05,359
- Sorry, man.
- Sorry, bro.

776
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,401
We don't have to use that
on ourselves, do we, Barry?

777
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:09,692
- Course we do, bro.
- But it's our choice, right?

778
00:46:09,818 --> 00:46:11,984
- Fess? Fess?
- What?

779
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:15,192
It is your choice. Right? 
It can only be your choice.

780
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:17,776
Right, yeah.

781
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:19,984
- Fess. Fess.
- What?

782
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:22,567
It is your choice, right,

783
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:25,109
but you've chosen to blow 
yourself up, haven't you?

784
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,317
Haven't you?

785
00:46:34,818 --> 00:46:36,859
Mashallah, brother Crow.

786
00:46:36,985 --> 00:46:38,568
Mashallah.

787
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:42,860
You're doing this, right,
to save brother Faisal.

788
00:46:43,944 --> 00:46:46,818
And I know it's come
as a bit of a shock to you,

789
00:46:46,944 --> 00:46:49,401
but everything will be all right.

790
00:46:49,527 --> 00:46:53,651
Yeah? OK.
You see that over there?

791
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:54,818
That ...

792
00:46:56,027 --> 00:46:59,318
That's a sex shop. Right?

793
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:02,735
A U.S. embassy, or some 
other such slag utility.

794
00:47:04,402 --> 00:47:06,651
Right, now wait there.

795
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:10,235
When I say, you fly to the target.

796
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:13,526
When I dial this, you go 
to heaven, brother Crow.

797
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:18,068
Inshallah.

798
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:47,901
Yeah.

799
00:47:48,027 --> 00:47:51,192
What's that?
What's that, Mrs. Thistle?

800
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:53,234
No, I don't want to resit
my media studies.

801
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,609
Stupid Mrs. Thistle,
I don't want to retake it.

802
00:47:56,735 --> 00:47:59,901
You know why? Cos I've 
found a new purpose in life.

803
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:03,401
And here it is. Eat that shit!

804
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:06,776
Eat that. Eat that. You fuck ...

805
00:48:07,777 --> 00:48:10,317
Come on, lads. Let's go.
Salaam alaykum.

806
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:13,901
- Alaykum salaam.
- You all right? Where are they?

807
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:17,026
They've all gone, man. They're 
using the fireworks for cover.

808
00:48:17,152 --> 00:48:20,275
Yeah, I know that. That was my idea.
Why didn't they wait for me?

809
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:23,067
- Barry said that you said, 
"Go ahead." │- Did he?

810
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:25,484
- I'm just on night shift.
- Yeah, you are, bro.

811
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,025
If anybody comes knocking for Barry,
tell them you used to know him ...

812
00:48:36,693 --> 00:48:38,484
Can I come?

813
00:48:48,776 --> 00:48:51,233
Don't drop it, you prick!

814
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,942
Brother Faisal, if you drop this,
we're baked beans from here to Derby.

815
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,942
- Slowly, slowly.
- Oh!

816
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:00,108
- It's good.
- All right.

817
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:03,442
- Good, good.
- Let's get out of here.

818
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,358
- OK.
- Come on. I'm gonna blow it.

819
00:49:06,484 --> 00:49:08,233
- Ready?
- All right.

820
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:12,317
Is it gonna be loud?

821
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:26,650
Did you see that?

822
00:49:26,776 --> 00:49:30,191
Fucking good, Barry. Fucking good.
That were proper good!

823
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:33,275
- Well done, Barry.
- What's up?

824
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:35,608
Did you miss it, bro?
Did you miss it, bro?

825
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:41,400
I told you before, Barry, didn't I?
What were you lads playing at?

826
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:45,733
- Why didn't you call me, Waj? Eh?
- I didn't have no credit.

827
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:51,775
This breaks anti-surveillance protocol.
We shouldn't be back here till tomorrow.

828
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:54,608
The protocol is that you were supposed
to stay here and guard the flat, Barry,

829
00:49:54,734 --> 00:49:56,733
'cos there's a good chance
that you are being monitored.

830
00:49:56,859 --> 00:50:00,399
Is that an Islamic argument, brother?
I only listen to Islamic arguments.

831
00:50:00,525 --> 00:50:02,524
That was my microwave, Barry.
I had it ten years, that Matsui.

832
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,066
I should've been there.

833
00:50:04,192 --> 00:50:06,358
Your microwave
has been well sacrificed.

834
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:08,942
Don't screw with my jihad.
I'm telling you for the last time.

835
00:50:09,068 --> 00:50:11,692
- Your jihad? You said "my jihad".
- Our jihad. Don't screw with it.

836
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:13,650
- Our jihad.
- What did he say, Fess?

837
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:16,109
- Did he say "my jihad"?
- What difference does it make?

838
00:50:16,235 --> 00:50:20,025
- You said "my jihad". │- So what? 
This is such a small thing.

839
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:21,400
Hey!

840
00:50:21,526 --> 00:50:23,109
Come and have a look at this.

841
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:30,275
♪ Dancing in the moonlight ♪

842
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:35,108
♪ Everybody's feeling 
warm and bright ... ♪

843
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:38,650
Hass!

844
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:40,983
Claude!

845
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:47,608
Shit!

846
00:50:57,859 --> 00:50:59,567
Right, it's time to go now, Alice.

847
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:01,817
Why? What's going on?

848
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:03,567
Nothing. We just need you to go.

849
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,983
Oh.

850
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:13,025
Oh, I get it. I know 
what's going on here.

851
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,233
I know what you lot are.

852
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:22,608
You lot ...

853
00:51:22,734 --> 00:51:24,733
are a bunch of Paki-bashers.

854
00:51:27,276 --> 00:51:31,941
- What?
- Mountie boys. Gays.

855
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:35,983
- Yes, we are so gay.
- I'm not.

856
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:37,649
Yes, you are. We all are.

857
00:51:37,776 --> 00:51:40,566
But mainly it's these two.
Isn't it, Norman?

858
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:46,233
- Yes.
- Yeah, you love it, don't you?

859
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:49,149
We've got to get down to some 
gay business now, all of us.

860
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:56,483
You lot aren't my friends any more.

861
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,441
Safe, is he?

862
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:08,732
She didn't see anything, man.
I swear to God, she didn't see the ...

863
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,566
The bolts and the ...
I'll sort this out.

864
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:14,441
I'll sort it out, man.
Just give me a minute.

865
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:16,191
I'll go down and 
sort this shit out.

866
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:18,482
You are going to sort it out
'cos you're going to kill her.

867
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:19,649
Kill her?

868
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,649
We're gonna kill her?

869
00:52:23,775 --> 00:52:25,691
Not us, Waj. Hass.

870
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:29,191
You want me to kill her?

871
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:33,232
What, you can fuck her but you can't 
kill her? What's wrong with you?

872
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:41,857
Give him your pocket knife, Barry.

873
00:52:41,983 --> 00:52:45,024
There we go. There. Knife and fork.
Make a fucking meal of it.

874
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,024
I'm not joking, bro.
Do I look like I'm joking?

875
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,774
No. Now go on your way.

876
00:53:04,108 --> 00:53:05,149
How do I do it?

877
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:08,024
Cut her head off
and bring it back in a bucket.

878
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:09,774
Chop her head off?

879
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,899
We're not really gonna kill her, 
are we? You fucking idiot!

880
00:53:13,025 --> 00:53:14,982
Why don't we just call up 
the pigs and dob ourselves in.

881
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,815
That'd be clever. A body on our 
hands to trail back to us.

882
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:19,273
Shut up!

883
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:21,190
What are we gonna 
do with all this?

884
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:23,357
She's seen it now.
We've got to move it now.

885
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:25,857
- We're gonna put it in Barry's 
allotment. │- We'll put it ...

886
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:27,857
Shut up, Barry. Solved.
Problem solved.

887
00:53:27,983 --> 00:53:29,898
Daddy's come home and wiped 
everyone's arse, hasn't he?

888
00:53:30,024 --> 00:53:33,815
That's what jihad's about.
It's me wiping your arses.

889
00:53:33,941 --> 00:53:35,941
Oh, sorry. One minute. Hello, Gaza?

890
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:39,774
Yeah, Omar would love to come and 
help but he can't, he's really busy ...

891
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,316
wiping up the fountains of shit
spraying out the arses of these ...

892
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,732
OK, thank you.

893
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,399
Who were on the phone?

894
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:05,816
Slow down, please.

895
00:54:10,025 --> 00:54:12,524
Get us there in one piece, Barry.
Go easy.

896
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:15,691
Go easy!

897
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:19,857
Oh! Oh!

898
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:22,274
Don't rattle the stuff, Barry.
Slow down, man.

899
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,065
Use your eyes, boys.
We've got a predator.

900
00:54:24,192 --> 00:54:26,565
What, the milk float?

901
00:54:26,691 --> 00:54:29,774
- That's a milk float! 
- The Feds work undercover, you mug!

902
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:32,149
No, no.

903
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:34,357
No, no!

904
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,274
No, don't do this to me!

905
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,815
Come on!

906
00:54:42,816 --> 00:54:44,815
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck!

907
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:48,649
Fuck, fuck, fuck it!

908
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:52,690
- Did you fix this, then, Barry?
- Yes, I fixed it!

909
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:55,482
- Did you?
- It's the parts. They're Jewish.

910
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:57,648
What parts in a car are Jewish?

911
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:04,315
- Spark plugs?
- Spark plugs.

912
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:07,690
Jews invented spark plugs
to control global traffic.

913
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:12,732
Right, everybody calm down.
We're gonna grab the gear and walk.

914
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:16,357
All right, but check the roofs, boys.
There could still be an ambush.

915
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:19,190
Careful, careful with that. 
Watch out.

916
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:24,315
Easy does it. 
Just act natural. OK?

917
00:55:26,816 --> 00:55:29,106
One jolt and this stuff 
could go, right?

918
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:31,690
You got to run smooth, right?

919
00:55:31,816 --> 00:55:34,440
You got to run fast, but you 
got to run smooth, right?

920
00:55:34,566 --> 00:55:35,981
Like this, right?

921
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:39,731
This is fast but slow,
smooth but fast.

922
00:55:39,857 --> 00:55:43,315
Barry, we're fine! Lads, we're fine!
There's no need for any of this.

923
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:46,148
We're fine, are we?
We're fucking surrounded. Look.

924
00:55:46,274 --> 00:55:48,148
- Everybody get off the road.
- Omar!

925
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:51,356
Anybody talks, I'm gonna make them
jump up and down till they go bang.

926
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:55,148
Just keep your mouths shut and 
let me deal with this, all right?

927
00:55:55,274 --> 00:55:58,023
Hey, man. How's it going?

928
00:55:58,149 --> 00:56:00,481
Nice little one-pack
you got going on there, bro.

929
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,939
You're a pint of sauce, Omar.

930
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:05,273
Have you managed to run a mile yet
without stopping for a milkshake?

931
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:08,356
- Make that 12 miles, Mr. Khan. 
All right, lads? │- All right.

932
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:10,606
What's with the bags?

933
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:11,856
- Shopping.
- Marzipan.

934
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:13,231
- Toys.
- Chicken.

935
00:56:15,024 --> 00:56:17,773
- We're about to go and 
play football. │- Yeah?

936
00:56:17,899 --> 00:56:20,106
We should grab all this kit
and head down there to the pitch.

937
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:21,981
- Yeah.
- All right, bro.

938
00:56:22,107 --> 00:56:23,648
Right. See you in a bit, man.

939
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:29,064
Hey, lads. Wait, look.
You forgot this.

940
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,814
- Hey! Hey!
- Aahh!

941
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:36,647
What's that?

942
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:39,814
That bag's full of really fragile ...

943
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,939
boots.

944
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,689
- Are they all right? │- Yeah. 
That's just thigh exercises.

945
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:50,106
- What? │- Quad squats. 
You know, squat jogs.

946
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:53,606
It's just ... It's for the 
marathon. I thought you'd know.

947
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:56,772
- Yeah? Squat jogs?
- Yeah.

948
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:58,981
All right, man. See you in a bit.

949
00:56:59,107 --> 00:57:00,272
Like that.

950
00:57:00,398 --> 00:57:02,106
- Squat jogs, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

951
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:04,482
- Down?
- Bit lower.

952
00:57:04,608 --> 00:57:06,398
- Safe-age, mate!
- All right, man.

953
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:12,815
- Take care, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

954
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:35,898
- All right, brothers?
- Oh, Alhamdulillah, bro.

955
00:57:36,024 --> 00:57:37,273
- Yeah.
- We skilled it.

956
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:38,440
Where's Faisal?

957
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:42,189
Hey, boys. Boys, come 
and have a look at this.

958
00:57:43,357 --> 00:57:44,856
Can you see him?

959
00:57:46,732 --> 00:57:48,523
Hey, bro!

960
00:57:48,649 --> 00:57:50,023
Run!

961
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:52,981
Hey, brother Faisal!

962
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:54,481
Over the wall, Faisal!

963
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:57,898
- Yeah, run faster, bro!
- Yeah, but not too fast!

964
00:58:34,023 --> 00:58:35,481
Where is he?

965
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:01,522
- It was a martyr's death. 
- Gone to paradise, innit, brother Omar?

966
00:59:02,898 --> 00:59:06,772
- He disrupted the infrastructure.
- How did he do that?

967
00:59:07,856 --> 00:59:09,730
He took out a sheep.

968
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,564
Magnificently took it right out.

969
00:59:15,065 --> 00:59:16,105
Did he?

970
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:21,855
- Attacked the food supply.
- Some of it's in there ... with him.

971
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:24,813
- What?
- I couldn't separate it.

972
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:31,522
So what is he, lads? Is he a 
martyr or is he a fucking jalfrezi?

973
00:59:31,648 --> 00:59:34,480
- He's a martyr.
- Right, this is bullshit!

974
00:59:34,606 --> 00:59:37,188
- He is not a martyr.
- Yes, he is. He's part of the war.

975
00:59:37,314 --> 00:59:39,938
What war?
The war on kuffar sheep?

976
00:59:40,064 --> 00:59:43,522
- He's the first hero of the final jihad.
- He's not a hero, he's a dickhead.

977
00:59:43,648 --> 00:59:45,855
And so are you, 
you're all dickheads.

978
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:47,730
Whoa, brother. 
That is out of order.

979
00:59:47,856 --> 00:59:51,521
I've made a decision, Barry.
The mission's off.

980
00:59:51,648 --> 00:59:54,688
It's finished, I'm done with this.

981
00:59:54,814 --> 00:59:57,896
You can't handle the war, brother.
You're having a wobble.

982
00:59:58,022 --> 01:00:00,563
I've got nothing to have a wobble 
about. My conscience is clear.

983
01:00:00,689 --> 01:00:02,480
- You're the one who killed Faisal!
- I didn't kill him!

984
01:00:02,606 --> 01:00:04,646
Yes, you did, you 
brought TV Paki in ...

985
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:06,646
after you saw him making 
an arse out of himself ...

986
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:09,230
at a public meeting you 
shouldn't even have been at.

987
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,855
And he blew our cover.

988
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:13,105
Ever since then, you've 
had everybody so paranoid,

989
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:15,938
poor little Faisal's
panicked himself to death.

990
01:00:16,064 --> 01:00:18,896
- So really Hassan killed him.
- No, you killed him.

991
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:21,354
No, you killed him.
You heard what he said.

992
01:00:21,481 --> 01:00:24,771
- You killed him more. │- I thought 
it was a good thing he died.

993
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:26,979
Isn't he a martyr?
It's a good thing, right?

994
01:00:28,855 --> 01:00:30,479
All right, I did kill him, then.

995
01:00:30,605 --> 01:00:33,648
I martyred him. He's up there 
now, keeping my seat warm.

996
01:00:36,982 --> 01:00:40,315
- Come on, our kid, let's go.
- I think I martyred him a bit, too.

997
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:42,148
What?

998
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:45,398
- We got to keep on.
- You got a plan, Waj?

999
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:50,190
- Blow something up.
- What are we going to blow up, Waj?

1000
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:53,606
Internet.

1001
01:00:53,732 --> 01:00:56,690
We'll blow up the internet
for brother Faisal.

1002
01:00:56,816 --> 01:00:58,523
We're mujahid, brother, yeah?

1003
01:00:58,649 --> 01:01:00,106
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, yeah?

1004
01:01:00,232 --> 01:01:02,398
You're not a mujahid.
You're a fucking idiot.

1005
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:05,856
Do you think a real mujahid gives a 
fuck about Rubber Dinghy Rapids ...

1006
01:01:05,982 --> 01:01:08,231
and gets his deen from
The Cat That Went To Mecca,

1007
01:01:08,357 --> 01:01:11,189
a book he can't finish 'cos it's 
far too fucking advanced for him?

1008
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:14,189
I tell you what, I've got a plan 
for you. Why don't you go with ...

1009
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:18,231
and lose yourself in the forest?

1010
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,814
Omar!

1011
01:01:59,857 --> 01:02:01,397
Salaam, Omar.

1012
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:03,231
Salaam alaykum, bro.

1013
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:09,855
You and your boys look like ...
something rubbish.

1014
01:02:10,523 --> 01:02:11,980
You all right, Omar?

1015
01:02:13,606 --> 01:02:15,397
Yeah, yeah. I am, as it goes.

1016
01:02:17,356 --> 01:02:20,647
- Listen, can I ask you something?
- Why not, brother?

1017
01:02:22,023 --> 01:02:25,189
Screw it, doesn't matter. You've 
already started doing the face.

1018
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:27,314
Why not come to our 
study group, Omar?

1019
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,105
What, and get a 4-hour 
dose of that face?

1020
01:02:30,231 --> 01:02:33,980
The floaty face of the wise bird,
hovering on a million quotes,

1021
01:02:34,106 --> 01:02:37,272
about to do a massive 
wisdom shit on my head.

1022
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:38,855
Forget it.

1023
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:12,938
Omar, what are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.

1024
01:03:14,314 --> 01:03:15,563
What is that?

1025
01:03:15,689 --> 01:03:18,855
- It's a puffin party.
- A what?

1026
01:03:18,981 --> 01:03:20,938
- It's a puffin party.
- A puffin party?

1027
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:24,938
- I'm talking to Waj's puffin.
- Omar, what are you talking about?

1028
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:27,730
It's the boys. I've left them.

1029
01:03:27,856 --> 01:03:32,230
Now Hassan's puffin won't talk to me,
Waj's puffin's just told me to piss off,

1030
01:03:32,814 --> 01:03:36,396
Barry's puffin's turned all red
and is hiding under the pirate hat.

1031
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:40,730
Faisal's dead.

1032
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:43,979
He's dead. They ...

1033
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:48,688
He was carrying explosives
and he tripped up over a sheep.

1034
01:03:51,272 --> 01:03:53,479
They're total idiots, Sof.

1035
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,313
Well, it must have been God's plan
for him to be blown up on a sheep.

1036
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,980
Come on, Sof.
How can that be God's plan?

1037
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:08,355
Well, it can't be God's plan to 
leave the lads with Barry, can it?

1038
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,105
Come here.

1039
01:04:17,481 --> 01:04:21,063
You were much more fun when you 
were gonna blow yourself up, love.

1040
01:04:22,648 --> 01:04:25,272
I am gonna blow myself up, right?

1041
01:04:25,398 --> 01:04:29,647
Just not in a mosque or in a 
chemist's or on top of a duck.

1042
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:33,855
Right, well, if they're gonna blow
themselves up in the wrong place,

1043
01:04:33,981 --> 01:04:37,563
you've got to make sure you 
all blow up in the right place.

1044
01:04:39,523 --> 01:04:43,230
Sof, I can't even get them to stir 
their tea without smashing a window.

1045
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:47,147
What does your heart say, hmm?

1046
01:04:47,273 --> 01:04:49,063
God's in your heart, Dad.

1047
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:51,480
Oi, you, come here.

1048
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:54,938
Sorry, I heard talking.

1049
01:04:56,272 --> 01:04:58,896
Can we finish off the 
story about Simba's jihad?

1050
01:04:59,022 --> 01:05:01,605
Yeah, we can do that tomorrow.
Come on, off to bed.

1051
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,646
Does he become a martyr, eh, Dad?

1052
01:05:05,772 --> 01:05:08,896
Don't you worry, 'cos even 
if he gets blown to bits,

1053
01:05:09,022 --> 01:05:10,480
he's gonna die smiling.

1054
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:13,938
- He'll go straight to heaven.
- Yeah.

1055
01:05:14,064 --> 01:05:16,730
He'll be in heaven before 
his head hits the ceiling.

1056
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:38,896
An Asian man's head was found less
than 2 miles from the city centre today.

1057
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:42,146
Steven Fap discovered
the Asian man's head ...

1058
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:45,104
when it nearly fell onto 
his dog out of a tree.

1059
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:47,854
A head fell out of the tree
and nearly hit my dog.

1060
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,021
The man has not been identified,

1061
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:54,771
but it seems that he may have died
while trying to cause an explosion.

1062
01:06:04,272 --> 01:06:06,521
- Yo, Matt ... Is Matt here?
- He's in the back.

1063
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:08,729
- Terry, step outside, bro.
- Say that again.

1064
01:06:08,855 --> 01:06:10,604
I need you to go outside.
Get a doughnut.

1065
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:14,104
- I've got one.
- Get another one.

1066
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,604
- Matt?
- Oh, thanks!

1067
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:16,896
- Omar?
- Yeah, mate.

1068
01:06:17,022 --> 01:06:19,771
- Can you can help me with this?
- I got to ask you something first.

1069
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:21,854
I booked a clown and 
they gave me this.

1070
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,562
It's the wrong way up. I can't 
run in a wrong-way-up clown!

1071
01:06:24,688 --> 01:06:26,062
They said, "You ordered it."

1072
01:06:26,188 --> 01:06:28,270
- Why would I order a wrong-
way-up clown? │- It's fine.

1073
01:06:28,397 --> 01:06:30,812
- I can sort you out.
- I didn't even know what one was.

1074
01:06:30,938 --> 01:06:33,687
I can sort you out with another 
costume so you can do the marathon.

1075
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:37,104
I said, "You're gonna cause a 
pile-up at the marathon with me ...

1076
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:40,270
"flat to my arse in a costume
I can't even bloody believe exists."

1077
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,854
I've got you a rabbit costume at home.
You can run the marathon in that.

1078
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,687
- Can I run in a rabbit?
- Course you can.

1079
01:06:45,813 --> 01:06:48,437
It's amazing. It's a rabbit, 
right? Panic over. Done?

1080
01:06:48,563 --> 01:06:50,604
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- I've got to ask you something.

1081
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,645
Have you?
Have you seen the news?

1082
01:06:52,771 --> 01:06:54,895
- Yeah, the head.
- What do you know about that?

1083
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:57,479
Well, they're just 
saying it's jihadi.

1084
01:06:57,605 --> 01:07:00,145
They've got him.
Filmed him blowing up a crow.

1085
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:05,145
Its not jihadi, though, is 
it, Omar, blowing up a crow?

1086
01:07:05,979 --> 01:07:07,020
Omar?

1087
01:07:08,063 --> 01:07:11,937
No, it's a cultural thing. We bazooka-ed
an ostrich at that wedding I was at.

1088
01:07:12,063 --> 01:07:15,562
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I ... I've got to go, Matt.

1089
01:07:22,229 --> 01:07:23,270
Shit!

1090
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:26,770
God help us.

1091
01:07:31,189 --> 01:07:34,896
- That's the police, man.
- All right. Arm yourselves.

1092
01:07:36,064 --> 01:07:37,771
All right?

1093
01:07:38,564 --> 01:07:39,937
- Oi.
- Get out of my way, Barry.

1094
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:44,312
Oi! Fuck off out the back door!
You're not part of this now.

1095
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:47,229
Lads, this is an emergency.
They found Faisal's head.

1096
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:50,146
The head that you buried 5 ft.
underneath your shed ...

1097
01:07:50,272 --> 01:07:52,062
fell out of a tree onto a dog.

1098
01:07:52,188 --> 01:07:54,062
Good. Dogs contradict Islam.

1099
01:07:54,188 --> 01:07:55,812
Dibble is onto us, lads.

1100
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,604
- Dibble is on to us.
- I told you, it was a knee.

1101
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,604
That was a head.
It was obviously a head.

1102
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:02,896
It had a hinge!

1103
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:06,062
Right. So, I've just seen Matt.

1104
01:08:06,188 --> 01:08:08,604
Matt is running the 
London marathon tomorrow.

1105
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,270
He's doing it in costume.

1106
01:08:10,397 --> 01:08:12,312
You know they run in costume?
Well, so can we.

1107
01:08:12,438 --> 01:08:15,270
We can disguise the gear 
in there and it's perfect.

1108
01:08:15,396 --> 01:08:18,229
We've got live TV, prime 
targets all along the road.

1109
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:20,354
We've got a target, Omar.
It's the mosque.

1110
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,520
When you meet God,

1111
01:08:21,646 --> 01:08:24,270
do you want to tell him,
"I struck a blow for the brothers"?

1112
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:28,145
- Or "I blew a load of them up"?
- Blew a load of 'em up. He'll love that.

1113
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,604
Come on, lads. Waj?

1114
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,979
I'm not on your side 
any more, brother Omar.

1115
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:37,520
- You ripped me up, bro.
- Mashallah.

1116
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,104
Waj, bro ...

1117
01:08:40,605 --> 01:08:42,395
I'm really sorry.

1118
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:44,853
My head was in a 
mess 'cos of Faisal.

1119
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,270
I should've stayed.

1120
01:08:49,813 --> 01:08:51,395
Why didn't you, then?

1121
01:08:51,521 --> 01:08:53,062
Cos I made a mistake.

1122
01:08:53,188 --> 01:08:56,437
But you didn't. You listened to your 
heart and you did the right thing.

1123
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:02,103
No, ignore him, Waj. He's being nice.

1124
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:04,645
You cannot win an argument
just by being nice.

1125
01:09:04,771 --> 01:09:07,478
Not just by being nice, Baz.
I'm right as well, aren't I?

1126
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:09,770
You cannot win an argument
just by being right.

1127
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,728
- No?
- No. No way.

1128
01:09:13,896 --> 01:09:17,061
- I think maybe you can, Barry?
- Who asked you, fuck-brain?

1129
01:09:24,937 --> 01:09:27,478
Barry's not a good 
emir, brother Omar.

1130
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:30,353
He made me do bad 
stuff in the woods.

1131
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:31,936
Like what?

1132
01:09:33,854 --> 01:09:37,228
He said, if I was 
a proper mujahid,

1133
01:09:37,354 --> 01:09:39,228
I'd wiz in my own mouth.

1134
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:43,645
You made him wee in his own gob?

1135
01:09:44,562 --> 01:09:46,561
What is wrong with you, bro?

1136
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:48,269
It's submission.
It's the rules of submission.

1137
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,728
It felt really bad, brother.

1138
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:53,061
It's not too tricky
once you get the aim right,

1139
01:09:53,187 --> 01:09:56,186
but it just feels like 
really proper wrong.

1140
01:09:57,229 --> 01:09:59,811
All wee splashing off your teeth.

1141
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:10,644
Bro, I swear, bro, I may ask 
you to blow yourself up ...

1142
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,353
but I will never ask you
to piss in your own mouth.

1143
01:10:14,937 --> 01:10:16,769
- Yeah?
- Yeah, bro. Promise.

1144
01:10:18,812 --> 01:10:21,811
- No more widdle in my gob.
- Promise, bro.

1145
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:25,769
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1146
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:30,894
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, brother.

1147
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,686
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1148
01:10:39,687 --> 01:10:41,019
See this, brother Hass?

1149
01:10:41,145 --> 01:10:43,769
It's gays at work.
It's not Muslims, it's gays.

1150
01:10:43,895 --> 01:10:46,894
OK, brother Hass,
marathon or mosque?

1151
01:10:48,437 --> 01:10:52,060
- Either way, we're gonna blow, right?
- Yeah, to pieces, brother.

1152
01:10:52,187 --> 01:10:55,602
Yeah, but ... we die smiling, bro.

1153
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:03,936
Yeah, wicked.

1154
01:11:04,062 --> 01:11:05,645
Wicked. Yeah, man.

1155
01:11:05,771 --> 01:11:08,186
Let's blow up a load off it 
slags at the marathon, yeah?

1156
01:11:08,312 --> 01:11:09,311
Oh, yes!

1157
01:11:09,437 --> 01:11:11,020
Yes, bro.

1158
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:12,645
Wicked. Yes!

1159
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:14,353
Come on, Barry. We're lions, bro.

1160
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,103
- Four lions.
- Yes!

1161
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:18,145
Good lad.

1162
01:11:21,729 --> 01:11:23,311
Down on the floor!

1163
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:45,353
I'll be two minutes.

1164
01:11:58,145 --> 01:12:00,352
What's it concerning?

1165
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,769
We trying to ascertain the where-
abouts of your brother-in-law.

1166
01:12:02,895 --> 01:12:03,936
Why, what's up?

1167
01:12:04,062 --> 01:12:06,311
Tell us when you saw him last.

1168
01:12:07,478 --> 01:12:09,477
Well ...

1169
01:12:09,603 --> 01:12:11,269
I can't remember the 
last time I saw him.

1170
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:16,686
Right, nurse, 
still on shift? Sorry.

1171
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:20,061
So, I've got the stats 
back from cubicle seven.

1172
01:12:20,187 --> 01:12:23,019
They need some more blood 
supplies for the knee.

1173
01:12:23,145 --> 01:12:24,186
The what?

1174
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:27,061
Yes, the knee string.
The knee string's come off.

1175
01:12:27,187 --> 01:12:29,269
Hm.

1176
01:12:29,395 --> 01:12:31,394
I've finished my shift now.

1177
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,477
So I'm going to take my 
team up to the top floor.

1178
01:12:34,603 --> 01:12:35,810
- Right?
- OK.

1179
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:37,477
So I'll see you up there.

1180
01:12:39,353 --> 01:12:40,685
Yeah?

1181
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:43,810
- OK.
- Yeah?

1182
01:12:43,936 --> 01:12:46,644
You all right, lads.
You going to arrest me?

1183
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,102
- No, no.
- Carry on.

1184
01:12:48,228 --> 01:12:50,060
OK.

1185
01:12:54,478 --> 01:12:58,602
Right, so your brother-in-law,
when was the last time you saw him?

1186
01:12:58,728 --> 01:13:01,310
Er, like I said, 
about two months ago.

1187
01:13:37,353 --> 01:13:39,851
♪ Dancing in the moonlight ♪

1188
01:13:39,977 --> 01:13:44,601
♪ Everybody's feeling warm and bright ♪

1189
01:13:44,727 --> 01:13:48,351
♪ Such a fine and natural sight ♪

1190
01:13:48,477 --> 01:13:53,060
♪ Everybody's dancing 
in the moonlight ... ♪

1191
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:19,268
Come on lads, we're late.

1192
01:14:21,769 --> 01:14:23,851
- Is it all right?
- It's all right there now.

1193
01:14:23,977 --> 01:14:26,144
- Yeah. │- Right, we're 
nearly done, our kid.

1194
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,810
Yeah, nearly done.

1195
01:14:27,936 --> 01:14:29,477
- OK?
- Yeah.

1196
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:36,894
Mujahid, brothers!

1197
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:40,060
- Mujahid.
- Mujahid, brother Hassan.

1198
01:14:40,186 --> 01:14:41,435
Mujahid!

1199
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,727
Defo right thing, yeah, bro?

1200
01:14:46,853 --> 01:14:48,227
What?

1201
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:50,643
Blowing up kuffar and that?

1202
01:14:50,769 --> 01:14:53,102
- Totally legit, yeah?
- Yeah.

1203
01:14:53,228 --> 01:14:54,685
Good. Wicked.

1204
01:14:55,644 --> 01:14:58,018
I was just ... 
just checking and that.

1205
01:14:59,769 --> 01:15:03,477
Waj, don't listen 
to your brain, bro.

1206
01:15:03,603 --> 01:15:07,143
OK? The shaitan, he gets 
in there with his wasa-wasa.

1207
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:11,102
What you've got to do, you've got 
to listen to your heart. Remember?

1208
01:15:11,228 --> 01:15:14,977
- My heart. Yeah, brother Omar.
- So, what does your heart say?

1209
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:16,851
It says, er ...

1210
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:19,060
"It's wrong, Waj, don't do it."

1211
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:24,518
And what does your brain say?

1212
01:15:29,227 --> 01:15:31,268
"We're here ...

1213
01:15:32,727 --> 01:15:35,185
"together, strapped up,

1214
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:38,268
"and it would be, like,
well pathetic to cop out now."

1215
01:15:38,394 --> 01:15:40,560
Right, um ...

1216
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:44,435
- So he should listen to his brain. │- No, 
he's got to listen to his heart, Barry.

1217
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:48,226
Anyway, this is Waj's brain. Since 
when do we listen to Waj's brain?

1218
01:15:48,352 --> 01:15:50,684
- Sorry, bro.
- No, I agree. I'm thick as fudge.

1219
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:53,601
His brain says do it, so his 
brain's got to be right!

1220
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:57,018
That can't be his brain, right?
That's his heart, Barry.

1221
01:15:57,144 --> 01:16:00,893
- Feels like my brain, brother.
- OK, this is what's happened.

1222
01:16:02,894 --> 01:16:05,393
What's happened is, the 
shaitan has confused you.

1223
01:16:06,935 --> 01:16:08,934
He's swapped round
your brain and your heart.

1224
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:13,684
So, don't listen to what 
you think is your heart,

1225
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,684
'cos that's actually your brain ―

1226
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:18,684
in disguise as your heart.

1227
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:21,726
Right? And what you thought
was your brain,

1228
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:23,934
that's ... that's your heart.

1229
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,809
That's actually your heart.

1230
01:16:27,935 --> 01:16:29,684
My brain is my heart.

1231
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:32,351
You got it, our kid. So just ...

1232
01:16:32,893 --> 01:16:33,934
What's up there?

1233
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,184
Heart.

1234
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:39,309
OK? Yeah? Follow your heart.

1235
01:16:39,435 --> 01:16:40,809
Nice one, brother.

1236
01:16:40,935 --> 01:16:43,642
- Right?
- Nice one. Alhamdulillah.

1237
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,809
- Hey, hey!
- What?

1238
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,851
Oh, behn choad!

1239
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:51,851
We're doing a fun run 
for a kid's charity.

1240
01:16:51,977 --> 01:16:54,100
Stretches, stretches, stretches.

1241
01:16:54,227 --> 01:16:56,517
- We're running for charity.
- What kind of charity?

1242
01:16:56,643 --> 01:16:58,184
- For kids.
- What kind of kids?

1243
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,475
Policemen's kids.

1244
01:17:01,018 --> 01:17:03,059
You all right, officer?

1245
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,725
- Late for the fun run, lads?
- What's it to you?

1246
01:17:05,851 --> 01:17:10,059
Yeah, we are, actually. Do you know
how we can get to the red zone?

1247
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:14,434
You can't run in that, can you?

1248
01:17:15,893 --> 01:17:17,975
He just drew the short straw.

1249
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,184
Four short straws were there?

1250
01:17:25,935 --> 01:17:28,225
Red zone? It's back 
down there, left.

1251
01:17:28,351 --> 01:17:32,267
Second left again, then there's marshals.
They'll tell you where to park.

1252
01:17:32,393 --> 01:17:33,850
Thank you.

1253
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:36,808
You're gonna die 
in that gear, lads.

1254
01:17:39,559 --> 01:17:41,725
- That's more than likely.
- Proper likely.

1255
01:17:41,851 --> 01:17:43,933
We're all going to die, yeah.

1256
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:46,308
It's all for a good cause, though.

1257
01:17:49,184 --> 01:17:51,058
Well, good luck.

1258
01:17:53,018 --> 01:17:54,602
Have a good day.

1259
01:17:54,728 --> 01:17:56,769
Everybody OK?
Everybody strapped up?

1260
01:17:56,895 --> 01:18:00,394
Got your detonator on?
Hass, you got your number?

1261
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,269
Hass, have you got your number?

1262
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:04,185
Hey!

1263
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:06,060
- Where the fuck has he gone?
- Shit!

1264
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:07,643
What the fuck's he doing?

1265
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,477
Help! Help!

1266
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:11,810
- I'm accidentally a 
suicide bomber! │- Stop!

1267
01:18:12,853 --> 01:18:15,227
- I've got a bomb!
- He's bottled it.

1268
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:17,518
It's the costume.
The legs make the hands go up.

1269
01:18:17,644 --> 01:18:20,685
- I've got a bomb but it's a mistake!
- No, he said he's got a bomb.

1270
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:23,852
- You've got a bomb?
- Yeah, but I'm not a bomber!

1271
01:18:23,978 --> 01:18:26,268
Don't worry.

1272
01:18:26,394 --> 01:18:28,477
- This is a fucking bad prank, mate!
- No, no!

1273
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:31,477
No, I'm real, but not any more.

1274
01:18:32,228 --> 01:18:33,852
You're real but not any more?

1275
01:18:33,978 --> 01:18:36,060
I don't understand.
Have you got a bomb?

1276
01:18:36,186 --> 01:18:37,893
Yes, but it's not going to go off.

1277
01:18:38,019 --> 01:18:40,601
- How do I know that?
- Look.

1278
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:51,060
We've got to go, now.

1279
01:18:51,186 --> 01:18:53,601
We need to go, now.

1280
01:18:53,727 --> 01:18:55,601
Now!

1281
01:19:03,561 --> 01:19:04,893
Go! Come on, go!

1282
01:19:05,394 --> 01:19:08,810
Waj, try and find some targets. I'll 
see you on the top floor, our kid.

1283
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:10,393
Radisson-style penthouse suite!

1284
01:19:10,519 --> 01:19:11,768
Smooth running, Waj.

1285
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:14,351
"Smooth running, Waj.
Smooth running."

1286
01:19:15,519 --> 01:19:17,893
- You killed Hassan!
- He bottled.

1287
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,351
You took away his choice.
You de-martyred him.

1288
01:19:20,477 --> 01:19:22,393
Did Waj have a choice
when you told him ...

1289
01:19:22,519 --> 01:19:25,893
his heart was his brain
and his gob was his ring piece?

1290
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,643
You tomatoed your friend.

1291
01:19:27,769 --> 01:19:30,393
- Barry ... │- You've killed 
the special-needs donkey.

1292
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:33,893
No, I haven't.

1293
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:36,226
Let him blow!

1294
01:19:36,352 --> 01:19:38,434
Let the retard blow!

1295
01:19:41,269 --> 01:19:42,767
Fuck!

1296
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,434
Oi, you, stop!

1297
01:20:46,935 --> 01:20:47,975
All right, bro?

1298
01:20:48,185 --> 01:20:49,225
Hey!

1299
01:20:53,726 --> 01:20:55,225
Stay there!

1300
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:58,100
I'm fucking loaded! Yeah?

1301
01:20:58,226 --> 01:21:00,933
No messing now, yeah?

1302
01:21:01,059 --> 01:21:03,933
That's it. Stay there.

1303
01:21:09,768 --> 01:21:11,808
Shut it. Shut the metal. Shut it.

1304
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:13,225
Shut it!

1305
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,808
Right, lads. See this, yeah?

1306
01:21:17,934 --> 01:21:19,266
Any of you do anything,

1307
01:21:20,018 --> 01:21:22,309
we're all turning baked 
beans, all right?

1308
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:24,517
No fucking messing now. Yeah?

1309
01:21:27,393 --> 01:21:30,851
Target confirmations are
ostrich and grizzly bear.

1310
01:21:30,977 --> 01:21:33,059
Ostrich and grizzly 
bear are the targets.

1311
01:21:40,685 --> 01:21:43,309
The bear is down. Repeat,
the bear is down. I got the bear.

1312
01:21:43,435 --> 01:21:45,726
I think that's a wookie.
That's a wookie.

1313
01:21:45,852 --> 01:21:47,226
No, it's not, it's a bear.

1314
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,017
Is a wookie a bear, control?

1315
01:21:50,143 --> 01:21:53,892
The bear target has changed. Target 
bear is now target Honey Monster.

1316
01:21:54,018 --> 01:21:56,267
Is a honey monster a bear?

1317
01:21:56,393 --> 01:21:58,850
A honey monster is not a bear.

1318
01:21:59,643 --> 01:22:01,392
A honey monster is a bear.

1319
01:22:01,518 --> 01:22:04,142
The honey monster is down.
He was a target. He was a bear.

1320
01:22:04,268 --> 01:22:05,517
The honey monster is down?

1321
01:22:05,643 --> 01:22:08,934
The honey monster is not down, 
control. We have a wookie down.

1322
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,850
- What's a wookie?
- A bear. It's a bear!

1323
01:22:11,976 --> 01:22:14,892
No, it is a wookie.
You've just shot it as a bear.

1324
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:17,559
- Is a wookie a bear?
- It's a bear. Repeat, it's a bear.

1325
01:22:17,685 --> 01:22:19,767
The wookie is down.
The wookie is not the target.

1326
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,809
Well, it must be the target.
I just shot it.

1327
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:31,642
I'll just finish this, then we're 
all off to heaven, all right?

1328
01:22:32,643 --> 01:22:34,725
Martyrs' suite, VIP lounge.

1329
01:22:36,059 --> 01:22:37,225
Are you going to kill us?

1330
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:40,892
Well, I might have some seconds,
but I kind of am, yeah.

1331
01:22:41,809 --> 01:22:42,892
Why?

1332
01:22:43,018 --> 01:22:45,850
For jihad, man. Kuffar and that.

1333
01:22:45,976 --> 01:22:47,475
But we support jihad, bro.

1334
01:22:48,768 --> 01:22:51,350
I can't explain it, lads, but ...

1335
01:22:51,476 --> 01:22:53,600
If brother Omar were here,

1336
01:22:53,726 --> 01:22:56,308
I swear he'd tell you 
knowledge proper good.

1337
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:20,308
- Omar?
- Waj?

1338
01:23:20,434 --> 01:23:22,058
- Are you in paradise, bro?
- No, bro.

1339
01:23:22,184 --> 01:23:24,975
- I'm in a cafe. Where are you?
- I'm in a kebab shop.

1340
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:28,391
I've got hostages and everything,
like Xbox Counter-Strike.

1341
01:23:28,517 --> 01:23:32,099
- Right, listen, Waj. You've got to ...
- Thing is, they're all brothers.

1342
01:23:32,226 --> 01:23:36,391
I still get points for taking them with 
me, though, yeah? Like Nectar card?

1343
01:23:38,392 --> 01:23:40,183
Omar?

1344
01:23:40,309 --> 01:23:43,558
- Let them all go. Just keep 
one of them. │- Eh?

1345
01:23:44,892 --> 01:23:47,349
Just grab one of them.
Let the rest of them go, Waj.

1346
01:23:47,475 --> 01:23:48,641
OK.

1347
01:23:49,475 --> 01:23:51,391
Right, you stay.

1348
01:23:51,517 --> 01:23:52,974
You three can go.

1349
01:23:55,892 --> 01:23:57,308
Go!

1350
01:23:57,434 --> 01:23:58,558
OK. Now listen, Waj.

1351
01:23:58,684 --> 01:24:01,099
What you were saying before
about this being wrong,

1352
01:24:01,225 --> 01:24:02,849
you were right, it is wrong.

1353
01:24:02,975 --> 01:24:04,849
- I don't ... What do you mean?
- For you.

1354
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:07,182
For you, Waj, doing what 
you're doing is wrong.

1355
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:10,807
Yeah, I know. It feels really wrong, 
bro. But that's why it's right, yeah?

1356
01:24:11,767 --> 01:24:13,891
No, you're confused, bro.

1357
01:24:14,017 --> 01:24:15,474
I'm not confused, brother.

1358
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,391
Yes, you are confused.
I confused you.

1359
01:24:18,517 --> 01:24:20,599
But when I'm confused,
I got my confused face.

1360
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:22,057
Wait.

1361
01:24:31,142 --> 01:24:35,016
Bro, I just took a picture of my 
face. It's defo not my confused face.

1362
01:24:35,142 --> 01:24:37,099
- Waj, I don't need ...
- I'll send it you.

1363
01:24:37,225 --> 01:24:39,099
Waj. Waj, wait.

1364
01:24:39,225 --> 01:24:40,890
Listen to me, Waj. Wait.

1365
01:24:41,016 --> 01:24:44,224
"Listen to me." It's too late to 
stick your hand up his arse now.

1366
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:48,890
Aargh!

1367
01:24:49,016 --> 01:24:50,182
Oh!

1368
01:24:50,309 --> 01:24:52,558
Ah, look at the Paki Bono.

1369
01:24:52,684 --> 01:24:54,100
You want to call him?

1370
01:24:54,226 --> 01:24:56,183
You want to call the 
special-needs donkey?

1371
01:24:56,309 --> 01:24:57,850
Here you go.

1372
01:24:57,976 --> 01:24:59,641
You forgot the SIM card.

1373
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:12,391
Mind out. Mind out the way.

1374
01:25:13,851 --> 01:25:15,683
Easy, chap. OK.

1375
01:25:15,809 --> 01:25:18,599
It's all right, I can Heimlich.
That's it, don't fight me.

1376
01:25:18,725 --> 01:25:20,974
- Wait.
- I've done this before, sonny.

1377
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,433
That's it. Don't fight it.

1378
01:25:22,559 --> 01:25:24,058
That's it, that's it.

1379
01:25:26,225 --> 01:25:27,974
And catch the peanut!

1380
01:25:52,558 --> 01:25:55,224
Number withheld.
I don't do "number withheld".

1381
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,891
Answer it, bro.
It could be important!

1382
01:25:57,017 --> 01:25:59,307
Hey, yeah. Maybe I won an iPhone.

1383
01:26:00,558 --> 01:26:02,516
- Waj?
- Have I won?

1384
01:26:02,642 --> 01:26:06,349
Waj, this is Ed. I'm with 
Special Branch. I'm just outside.

1385
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:09,474
- How did you get this number?
- Waj, can we talk?

1386
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,516
- Have you got agents at Orange?
- I'm sorry?

1387
01:26:12,642 --> 01:26:16,432
You've got proper double agents
working at Orange, haven't you?

1388
01:26:16,558 --> 01:26:19,515
I knew I should have gone to O2.
I've got loads of friends on O2.

1389
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:22,474
Waj, what are your demands?

1390
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:26,015
I don't have any.

1391
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:38,099
Excuse me, mate. Have you got
a SIM card for this phone, please?

1392
01:26:38,225 --> 01:26:41,765
Not for that model, but we can sort one 
out for you if you want to come with me.

1393
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:44,265
Can you make this work.
I need it. Is it on?

1394
01:26:44,391 --> 01:26:45,807
It's only a display model.
Do you want that one?

1395
01:26:45,933 --> 01:26:47,057
Yeah, I want it. I need it.

1396
01:26:47,183 --> 01:26:49,640
Gordon? Can you get that phone
for me, please, mate?

1397
01:26:57,474 --> 01:26:59,682
Waj, why are you doing this?

1398
01:26:59,808 --> 01:27:01,598
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1399
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:03,348
Sorry?

1400
01:27:03,474 --> 01:27:07,182
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, bro.
Fast track.

1401
01:27:07,308 --> 01:27:09,557
Straight on the rides, 
like Alton Towers.

1402
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:13,432
- No queue.
- You like funfairs then, Waj?

1403
01:27:13,558 --> 01:27:16,098
It's not a funfair, bro,
it's a theme park.

1404
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,140
Funfair? How old are you?

1405
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:20,265
Alton Towers got a spa, bro.

1406
01:27:22,599 --> 01:27:24,265
- Just now.
- All right, mate.

1407
01:27:24,391 --> 01:27:26,556
I'm doing it for you.
Would you like 12 months?

1408
01:27:26,682 --> 01:27:28,806
- Contract?
- Any.

1409
01:27:28,932 --> 01:27:30,765
- Do the call plan.
- All right, mate.

1410
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:34,223
Easy, bro, easy.
I'm doing it for you.

1411
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:38,265
- I think I'm going to go now, bro.
- Wait, Waj. What about girls?

1412
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:41,098
I bet you like the ladies.

1413
01:27:41,224 --> 01:27:43,348
Is this your first time, bro?

1414
01:27:43,474 --> 01:27:45,515
Are you a virgin at this?

1415
01:27:47,182 --> 01:27:49,181
Please, Waj, can we 
talk about girls?

1416
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:51,723
You fill that out. Fill it out.

1417
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:54,098
- What sort of call plan 
would you like? │- What?

1418
01:27:54,224 --> 01:27:56,389
We've got the Labrador?
The Dragon?

1419
01:27:56,516 --> 01:27:58,848
- Just any?
- How about the Hermit Crab?

1420
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:01,431
- Huh?
- It's 1,800 free texts.

1421
01:28:02,682 --> 01:28:03,723
Forget it.

1422
01:28:05,349 --> 01:28:06,514
I've still got your card.

1423
01:28:10,015 --> 01:28:11,681
OK, we can talk about girls.

1424
01:28:11,807 --> 01:28:15,098
Right so what sort of girls
are you into, then, Waj?

1425
01:28:15,224 --> 01:28:17,848
I don't know.
Ones with big jubblies and that.

1426
01:28:17,974 --> 01:28:19,849
- Yeah? You like them big, Waj?
- Yeah.

1427
01:28:19,975 --> 01:28:22,432
And nice fit arses, too, man.

1428
01:28:22,558 --> 01:28:24,932
You're an arse man, 
aren't you, Waj?

1429
01:28:25,058 --> 01:28:27,515
I knew you were, bro.
You're an arse man.

1430
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:29,640
You're a massive arse man.

1431
01:28:29,766 --> 01:28:32,890
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you're an arse man, Waj.

1432
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:36,390
You giving me batty chirps, bro?
You calling me a whammer?

1433
01:28:36,516 --> 01:28:39,140
- No.
- Fuck off!

1434
01:28:42,516 --> 01:28:44,890
Fucking Boy George!

1435
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:56,015
Don't worry, brother Nabil.

1436
01:29:01,016 --> 01:29:02,515
Hold on to these.

1437
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:04,056
When I press the clicker,

1438
01:29:04,183 --> 01:29:06,598
just think about 
taking out the kuffar.

1439
01:29:06,724 --> 01:29:08,598
You'll be in paradise 
before me, bro!

1440
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:11,265
But there's no kuffar here, bro.

1441
01:29:12,891 --> 01:29:14,765
Yeah, but ...

1442
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:18,681
Brother Faisal, he's a martyr
and he only blew up a sheep.

1443
01:29:20,891 --> 01:29:23,556
I think you might 
be confused, brother.

1444
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:26,598
I'm not.

1445
01:29:27,891 --> 01:29:29,765
You look confused.

1446
01:29:36,349 --> 01:29:38,264
Sorry. Matt!

1447
01:29:38,391 --> 01:29:41,306
- Omar!
- Matt!

1448
01:29:41,974 --> 01:29:44,848
Yeah, man, listen. Have you 
got a signal on your phone?

1449
01:29:45,557 --> 01:29:47,556
Yeah. What are you doing here?

1450
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:49,889
I'll level with you Matt. I'm Ml5.

1451
01:29:50,015 --> 01:29:52,639
Special undercover job. 
I'm a spook.

1452
01:29:52,765 --> 01:29:54,223
What?

1453
01:29:54,349 --> 01:29:56,139
So what's going on?

1454
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:57,806
Fathers 4 Justice.

1455
01:29:58,682 --> 01:30:01,431
They've teamed up with the Real 
IRA. It's the nightmare scenario.

1456
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:04,306
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Just give me five.

1457
01:30:11,598 --> 01:30:13,264
Fucking "number unknown" again.

1458
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:15,806
Is that whammer cop going 
straight to hell or what?

1459
01:30:17,432 --> 01:30:19,222
- What are you doing?
- Hello?

1460
01:30:19,348 --> 01:30:22,222
- Hello, Waj, bro. It's Omar.
- Omar?

1461
01:30:22,348 --> 01:30:23,306
Omar?

1462
01:30:23,432 --> 01:30:25,222
- Waj.
- Tell me what to do, bro.

1463
01:30:25,348 --> 01:30:28,264
I think I might be confused
but I'm not sure.

1464
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,139
Listen, bro.
You do what I do, right?

1465
01:30:30,265 --> 01:30:31,681
You do the same as me, OK?

1466
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:33,764
Yes, brother, I'll
do the same as you.

1467
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:37,139
Right, OK. I'm going 
give myself up, bro.

1468
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:39,389
- Eh?
- I'm going to give myself up, bro.

1469
01:30:45,056 --> 01:30:47,305
Waj? Waj!

1470
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:51,264
Waj? Waj?

1471
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,055
Brother, what am I?
What am I doing, brother?

1472
01:30:59,056 --> 01:31:02,014
- Waj! Waj!
- What am I doing, brother?

1473
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,889
- Pick up the phone!
- Bro, what am I doing?

1474
01:31:04,015 --> 01:31:05,639
All right, mate?

1475
01:31:06,806 --> 01:31:09,805
I'm sorry, lads. I don't 
really know what I'm doing.

1476
01:31:20,139 --> 01:31:26,180
What was that?

1477
01:31:32,389 --> 01:31:34,722
Are you all right?

1478
01:31:40,681 --> 01:31:42,680
Omar, are you all right?

1479
01:31:42,806 --> 01:31:46,096
Now, you stay here. And 
you tell them I were smiling.

1480
01:31:46,223 --> 01:31:47,723
What?

1481
01:31:48,807 --> 01:31:51,056
Smile on my face.
Could be important.

1482
01:31:51,182 --> 01:31:53,889
Right ... Smile.

1483
01:31:56,432 --> 01:31:58,264
- Is there?
- Yeah.

1484
01:32:02,848 --> 01:32:04,722
Where are you going?

1485
01:32:06,432 --> 01:32:08,347
Omar?

1486
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:58,430
This is RAF Mildenhall,

1487
01:32:58,556 --> 01:33:00,805
but it's actually Egypt.

1488
01:33:00,931 --> 01:33:05,305
When you entered the base,
you left Britain,

1489
01:33:05,431 --> 01:33:10,472
and you passed through U.S. juris-
diction and into this container,

1490
01:33:10,598 --> 01:33:15,388
which is internationally recognised
as the sovereign territory of Egypt.

1491
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:19,972
You are now in Egypt.

1492
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:24,763
There are some pretty hellish 
Egyptians behind that door there.

1493
01:33:24,889 --> 01:33:28,596
They use electrodes. 
They use drills.

1494
01:33:29,681 --> 01:33:32,680
Biro refills.
Do you know what I mean?

1495
01:33:32,806 --> 01:33:35,555
I don't know anything 
about my brother.

1496
01:33:39,972 --> 01:33:41,846
We know a lot more
than you think we do.

1497
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:49,721
All right, let's get one thing straight.
Omar Khan had nothing to do with this.

1498
01:33:51,306 --> 01:33:53,763
Cos I knew him and 
I worked with him.

1499
01:33:54,347 --> 01:33:57,638
Did you know
he was actually working for Ml5?

1500
01:33:57,764 --> 01:33:59,554
Cos he told me that himself.

1501
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:04,638
The report makes crystal clear
that the police shot the right man,

1502
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:08,221
but, as far as I'm aware,
the wrong man exploded.

1503
01:34:09,014 --> 01:34:10,513

01:34:49,347 --> 01:34:51,554
For my creed, I daheed

1514
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,137
What's "daheed", though?

1515
01:34:53,263 --> 01:34:54,554
Died.

1516
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,929
- Daheed, died. Daheed.
- That's bollocks, man.

1517
01:34:57,055 --> 01:34:59,596
- You're rhyming doolally.
- That's clear, man.

1518
01:34:59,722 --> 01:35:01,096
No, no, look. In my opinion ...

1519
01:35:01,222 --> 01:35:04,637
Look, no, man. In your opinion?
Your opinion's shit, man.

1520
01:35:04,763 --> 01:35:07,095
With all due respect, bro,
you like Maroon 5.

1521
01:35:07,221 --> 01:35:08,720
What the fuck's that about?

1522
01:35:08,846 --> 01:35:10,179
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

1523
01:35:10,305 --> 01:35:12,220
- Come here, man.
- I'm joking!

1524
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:35,556
When we talk about a so-called
terrorist attack on the London marathon,

1525
01:35:35,682 --> 01:35:37,764
we should remember one thing:

1526
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:41,139
Most loud bangs are not bombs,

1527
01:35:41,265 --> 01:35:43,347
they're scooters backfiring.

1528
01:35:53,473 --> 01:35:56,514
This footage, taken from 
an American spy plane.

1529
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:01,389
Appears to show two trainee Mujahideens
struggling with a rocket launcher.

1530
01:36:01,515 --> 01:36:04,305
Firing it at an Arab training camp ...

1531
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:08,222
and accidentally blowing 
up Osama bin Laden.

1532
01:36:14,681 --> 01:36:19,347
The western imperialist culture
has left you like materialist junkies,

1533
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:23,847
mainlining iPods and Humvees
and TK Maxx into a spiritual void.

1534
01:36:23,973 --> 01:36:26,305
Is Mad Qadeer watching this?

1535
01:36:26,431 --> 01:36:31,138
- What?
- Mad Qadeer, 'cos he owes me £200.

1536
01:36:33,098 --> 01:36:35,722
Mad Qadeer, if you're 
watching, right,

1537
01:36:35,848 --> 01:36:38,013
you owe me £200.

1538
01:36:38,139 --> 01:36:39,930
And you're gonna pay up.

1539
01:36:40,056 --> 01:36:41,888
Cos I'm not here right now.

1540
01:36:42,014 --> 01:36:44,763
I'm somewhere else,
but you're still gonna pay.

1541
01:36:46,348 --> 01:36:48,763
You're going to pay Saf.
Saf, if you're watching, bro,

1542
01:36:48,889 --> 01:36:51,221
you go round 
Mad Qadeer's house, right,

1543
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:55,305
and you get him to pay me my £200,
'cos he's owed it me a long time.

1544
01:36:58,597 --> 01:37:00,138
He owes me money.
